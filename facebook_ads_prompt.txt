Evolve business context:
Evolve Human Optimization Lab:
I. Company Description: The "Un-Spa" Wellness Playground

Evolve Human Optimization Lab is a modern wellness franchise that has strategically positioned itself as an "un-spa." Its core mission is to dismantle the traditional, high-friction wellness model by offering members unlimited, appointment-free access to a comprehensive suite of high-tech recovery and wellness therapies. This "wellness playground" concept shifts the industry paradigm from pre-scheduled, single-service appointments to a flexible, membership-based experience that encourages habitual use.

Operating on a franchise model with established locations in San Antonio and Dallas and an upcoming lab in Round Rock, Evolve is focused on strategic growth while maintaining a distinct "local feel" for each facility. A primary business challenge, and therefore a key marketing focus, is educating the public on its unique, category-defining model. The ultimate and most critical measure of success for all digital marketing efforts is the conversion of online interest into physical foot traffic through the doors of its labs.

II. Detailed Business Model

A. Core Concept & Value Proposition

Evolve's model is built on removing the primary pain points of the traditional spa experience. The central, overarching goal of all business strategy and marketing is to increase foot traffic into the physical locations, as the in-person experience is the most powerful conversion tool.

Frictionless Access and Financial Value: The all-inclusive, appointment-free model is the cornerstone of Evolve's appeal. For a single monthly fee, members gain unlimited access to every service, a significant financial incentive compared to competitors.

Holistic Health Optimization: The curated suite of services addresses a wide spectrum of wellness goals, including enhanced physical recovery, proactive biohacking, and effective stress reduction.

The Experiential Benefit: Evolve cultivates an environment that serves as a "third place" for its members. The model fosters an atmosphere of self-discovery, allowing members to explore different wellness modalities at their own pace, which is best understood through a physical visit.

B. Ideal Customer Profile (The "Gold Client")

Evolve targets a meticulously defined customer profile essential for its retention-focused business model.

Geographic Imperative: The single most critical attribute is proximity. The ideal customer lives or works within a 10 to 15-mile radius of a lab. Experience has shown that retention plummets beyond this distance, as the convenience factor is lost.

Behavioral Profile: The model is designed for high-frequency users. The "gold client" is someone who integrates Evolve into their weekly routine, visiting two to three times per week.

Psychographic & Motivational Profile: Data from customer intake forms reveals clear motivational drivers:

Workout Recovery (70%): This is the single largest driver for visitors. A remarkable 70% of guests list workout recovery as one of their reasons for visiting, making athletes and fitness enthusiasts the primary target segment.

Relaxation / "Me Time" (20%): The second most common motivation is the desire for relaxation. Approximately 20% of respondents state they are looking for a place to relax, positioning Evolve as an effective outlet for stress reduction and personal time.

The Wellness-Educated: A key target is the individual who is already knowledgeable about wellness trends, follows health influencers, and understands the benefits of services like cold plunges and saunas.

Exclusionary Profile: Evolve actively avoids marketing to what they term "tire kickers"—individuals attracted solely by free offers who lack the financial means or lifestyle commitment to convert to a full membership.

C. Market Positioning and Strategic Differentiators

Category-Defining Model: The all-access, no-appointment model is the primary competitive advantage, making it difficult for traditional competitors to replicate.

Comprehensive Service Offering: By providing a wide array of high-demand services under one roof—including the rare combination of both traditional and infrared saunas—Evolve establishes itself as a one-stop-shop for wellness.

First-Mover Advantage: The strategy is to expand and establish a dominant brand presence in key markets to secure local foot traffic before larger competitors can co-opt the innovative model.

III. Comprehensive List of Services

Evolve's services are categorized into temperature-based therapies, light/wave therapies, physical recovery tools, and active/cognitive training.

A. Temperature-Based Therapies

Cold Plunge: Immersing the body in ice-cold water in oversized, filtered tanks to improve recovery, circulation, and skin tone.

Norwegian Sauna: A traditional high-heat sauna used for detoxification, relaxation, and boosting cardiovascular and immune systems.

Infrared Saunas: Full-spectrum infrared saunas that heat the body directly for pain relief, detoxification, and improved cardiovascular function.

Contrast Therapy: Alternating between the Cold Plunge and Norwegian Sauna ("fire and ice") to build mental and physical resilience.

Cold Compression Sleeves: Combines cold and compression therapy to reduce inflammation and accelerate muscle and joint recovery.

B. Light & Wave-Based Therapies

Red Light Therapy: Uses low-wavelength red light to stimulate collagen and cell regeneration to improve skin texture and reduce wrinkles.

Tri-Vibe Experience: An immersive meditation aid using light patterns to enhance creativity, memory, and cognition.

Vibration Therapy: A vibrating platform used to increase muscle and bone strength, boost circulation, and reduce joint pain.

C. Physical & Mechanical Recovery

Compression Sleeves: Systematic air compression sleeves that increase blood flow to muscles for recovery.

Zero-Gravity Massage Chairs: High-tech chairs that replicate human touch with customized precision and optional heat.

Foam Rolling Station: A dedicated area with tools for self-myofascial release to relieve tension and improve mobility.

Percussion Massagers: Handheld "massage guns" that provide deep, percussive therapy to break up muscle knots.

D. Active & Cognitive Training

Cognitive and Neurotraining: A state-of-the-art touchscreen lightboard system to train reaction time, decision-making, and hand-eye coordination.

Interactive Stretching & Yoga: A self-guided space with interactive courses, mats, and props for practice.

Guided Meditation: A dedicated space for focused meditation to de-stress and improve brain function.

IV. Pricing & Revenue Model

Evolve's pricing is structured to maximize recurring revenue while using single-use passes as a strategic tool to achieve its primary goal of increasing foot traffic.

A. Tiered Monthly Membership Plans

4 Visits Membership: $89 / monthly

8 Visits Membership: $139 / monthly

12 Visits Membership: $189 / monthly

Unlimited Membership: $299 / monthly

B. Single Access Option (The Foot Traffic Driver)

Day Pass: Standard Price: $49

Strategic Role: This pass is not treated as a primary profit center but as the business's most crucial foot traffic acquisition tool. Promotional discounts (e.g., to $24.50) are used to lower the barrier to entry and entice qualified individuals to physically experience the lab. The conversion from a day pass visitor to a long-term member within the facility is the key to sustainable growth.

C. Other Payment & Access Information

HSA/FSA Reimbursement: Evolve advertises the ability for customers to use Health Savings Account (HSA) or Flexible Spending Account (FSA) funds, making their services more accessible.

Off-Menu Plans: The company utilizes unlisted, lower-cost plans as a retention strategy for members considering cancellation.

D. Franchise-Level Revenue
The corporate entity generates revenue through franchise fees and manages a collective "Brand Fund," contributed to by franchisees, for system-wide marketing initiatives.

Call Transcripts with the owners for more context:

 We're doing good, man. We're actually we're in Austin actually. We're going to we went to a concert last night and then we have one tomorrow. So we're like, well, we might as well just go. There you go. Yeah. And then tomorrow night it's the black keys. Oh, wow. Black keys should be fun. That sounds awesome. Yeah. Haram said you'll had fun, door pull and Wednesday. Yeah. I was going to see him and get to be part of the process for a minute. I feel like I need to run around. Got my cards at all times. Yeah. There you go. Oh, man, if I made a 40 year old dude that looks fit at the grocery store he's getting a day pass. I've had many in awkward like at HB, but now yeah, that's that strategy. It really works, man. And we've seen lately. The consistency of like we just have some of the works 20 hours a week going around doing events with partners and stuff. That's bringing in 20 to 50 new guests every month. So it's like, yeah, it's a recurring thing. So just to give you all full picture. This might help with M run as well. So we we definitely look at, you know, marketing and driving traffic to evolve as I was described as a lot of streams. So we're going to be a lot of people who are going to be floating into a river. You know, so that we have a consistent flow. We so we work with partners with evolve. We always say, you know, we created our own lane. So we don't do workouts and we don't do physical therapy or anything medical. So we work with local places. So often we work with gyms to capture their audience, even a rosti and some other partners. So that's that's pretty big. We still get 60% of our our new first time guests are referrals. So one of our strategies is we let guests. Hello. We met Chase. I Jeremy, I'm Chase. That's the me to you. This is me. Jason's our growth product project managers. Okay. Cool. And Courtney's here. Hi. I'm Courtney. So Chase, we're just describing some of the different ways that we drive traffic to evolve. And this is kind of high level. I know we're going to get to some more direct stuff. But since we're talking about evolve and general. I think it's useful. So yeah, partnerships and then members can bring a guest for free their first time. We get about 60% of our new new members from referrals. So it whether it's their partner friends, things like that. So we're constantly having that conversation. Especially with new members. That's a great opportunity for them to bring friends and stuff. And it's just their first time. But we tend to be generally pretty generous with passes like a first day pass when it's somebody's first time. And we can track that in the system. And then of course, we rely on digital media for what we want to be is like just a consistent flow. And my perspective like Google search is kind of the bedrock of that, you know, people that are searching for. And I really think just the heavy hitters. I want y'all's opinions. We can test whatever you think. But we try to look at the services that will actually drive traffic. And in my mind. And it's the course. Sonna would be top of the list. You can actually actually did some research into number of queries in Google based on each service in Texas and Sonna's are actually still king. So plunge is trending right now, but you're still going to see a lot more awareness and people looking for for Sonna, whether that's infrared or traditional. We can even use different terms for the Sonna like a Norwegian Sonna finished on a hot stone Sonna. There's a lot of terms around there that we want to capture. So if somebody's searching for those specific things. And I can give y'all a list of search terms if that's helpful because the Sonna world gets very deep and that's a it's a very trending thing right now. So Sonna and then red light is actually really, really high. I think last time I checked red light actually topped Sonna for searches and a lot of times anywhere else they're going to have to book an appointment and they're going to get charged 40, 30, 40, 50 bucks for red light therapy may not be good quality. So that's a big one that's included and we'll have two red light booths at this, you know, at a brown rock. We only have one in San Antonio, but Dallas has two and then coal plunge is. And I think those would be the main ones, you know, we've got of course a lot of other services, but when you get into searches like say massage chair. People are generally looking to purchase one. So we don't really see that as a good ad buy because we're going to be competing a lot. The price for acquisitions going to be pretty high. And it's pretty unlikely they're really looking to go enjoy on the size chair just from our experience. And also things like guided meditation maybe like therapy, you know, because that's such a specific thing. So, you know, what we call tri vibe is a light therapy or vibro acoustic therapy. Something like that you're just probably not going to see hardly any searches for it. So yeah, I consider search campaigns, the basis. One of the reasons we're having a conversation right now is our outgoing marketing company. I'm been used to me. I thought they were pausing Google display campaigns, but they actually paused our search campaigns. I'm not completely clear on when that happened. I was just went in there to check on things and they kind of stood behind that strategy because they said cost for acquisition was too high. You know, it is San Antonio. So yeah, we're not going to have nearly the amount of searches as other places, but I don't care. You know, somebody searching for sauna. We want them to show up at our page. And we're tracking very poorly for SEO in San Antonio. So I think it's not an important yesterday. I think we need a much more comprehensive strategy. We're putting a lot more content about the heavy hitter, sauna, co plunge. You know, we can have chat GPT right 50 articles on sauna and just put them up as backlink pages, but yeah, I'm running out of getting in your area of it. Wanted to give you some background on where we're at. So I think as I said, I on the last call, I think you are sitting on a gold mine of contents. Every practice every service. We'll need to be added is a prefix and a suffix of a sentence. For example, near me, sauna or sauna, near me, things like that. So there needs to be all permutation of combination of words. And the biggest thing I need, we need is density of the right keyword on the website. Okay. So this is how Google actually prioritizes you. So how we do increase the density. So that's why the content needs to be aligned. Then needs to at least stand or more use cases of the keywords. So the Google will prioritize you think this side actually serves or provides sauna services, right. One more thing you talked about is Google search. It doesn't have to be too expensive. You can just have something very nominal. Geobased Google search like, staying in the like five dollar ten. It doesn't have to be that expensive. So depending on your audience, that's what I'm going to say. If you spend like bucket lot of money, that's a different story. If you have the audience to set up, you can have it running silently piece by piece. And at the top of this is Google Maps. We talk about Google Maps. That's the king of everything, right. So you have to structure some campaign around Google Maps. Like, hey, give us a check in and it'll give you tenderlar coupon, things like that. So it's going to be physical and digital combination of a combined the combined attention here. Right. So what we can do and we already did some keyword research on the website and we found we you need to add more density on all the keywords you just mentioned. Yeah. And for example, cold plant is super trendy, super viral, but maybe not that popular in terms of service acquisition, but it is more viral, right. People read about it, but never actually does it. That's what I think about cold plants. And so on I is like very common service everybody buys it. This is what I'm I was going to say about. So whichever is more attractive keyword for audience to look into to learn about to see other people do it is what we should we should do it. And there's there's a section call UGC user generated content. You also have a huge volume of UG. Every customer is basically a potential source of the content that we can play with. And I'm going to pass it to taste. If you have any thoughts on what Jeremy said. Because I can see the content is the biggest game here and running ads based on the understanding from the content. We can do it several a bit of sting. For example, it can be be testing on the son or base. We can have three or four ads running at the same time. See which one picks up. Then we invest more on the one that actually picks up. Right. That's how we should move forward with it. And also the website is a low volume website is a long term investment as I mentioned. Website and YouTube is a long time investment. It may not give you a result. But it's going to give you a good result over like one year or six months of time. As you know, Google is very slow. Some is very slow in in terms of creating a new market. Google values are website every three to four months. But massage results may pop up very quickly. But overall domain value will be changing in three to four months maximum six months. So it takes time for you to see how much value you're getting. How much value your domain is getting over a quarter. Yeah, everyone you covered a lot of good stuff there. Nothing not a ton for me to add other than one idea that I think would be really good. So I think some some different kinds of shops do this is like local community events and challenges. A lot of that can go viral and I think that would be something that would work really well. You definitely care for with like health concerns and stuff, but like a cold plunge challenge like this there. And so you come in you can get a. And it's really good. We are in a very, very good. We did we couplunge almost 100 people at the same time. That was pretty fun. Without we'd get better PR for but it was right during the S. So it didn't get in it didn't catch on at any new stations or anything, but it was fun. Gotcha. Yeah, for sure. I think stuff like that though would be really fun to do first of all, but I think that could bring on a lot of people who are maybe on the edge. Like, oh, like a challenge can be a community thing. I think planning something out obviously that would need more planning kind of just a hypothetical thing, but I've seen some different people do stuff like that and it's worked really well. Yeah, that's really good. I was going to say, Jeremy, if you have. Yeah. Sorry, I said, please go ahead. I was just going to ask, I was saying, Chase, I think that's good because there's actually a strong market for charity events in Austin where people are always trying to come up with different views and like. You know, we'll we'll match fight. We'll donate five bucks for your person who gets in the full of plunger something like that being part of that story. The foot traffic. You know, I really want to focus a little bit on the now because this is not a new business. This is I want to make sure there's absolutely zero backsliding even though we are also full of ideas and helping launch roundrock. That's the new part for us with this is application. So can you walk me through like what is working now and what absolutely must maintain or increase. Yeah, and that's our frustration. We, you know, in San Antonio, we saw leads just greatly drop off and that's why I was in there kind of poking around and they've kind of exhausted our our manicured meta campaigns a little bit because, you know, San Antonio, we're it's not like Austin where we're going to have a, you know, we're on the unhealthiest city list compared to healthiest city list. We always enjoy the fact that we feel like we've we've made it successful despite our demographics in San Antonio, but we have to we have to constantly be marketing and staying out in front of it. And you know, we were with the company is called y'all, by the way, so if I say y'all, I'm not referring to you and referring to the so I'll try to say the company y'all, so there's no confusion, but they put in a pretty good effort initially and they improved our. Our ads on meta initially, but they kind of exhausted them and they, you know, the same people are seeing the ads multiple times I don't think they're getting creative enough. We do limit it to a 10 or 15 mile radius and we don't want to go outside of that because one thing that's really important for everybody understand is that we're our gold client is somebody that's going to come two to three times a week. And they're going to keep that membership for years so. This is a membership model in the best way for everyone to grow is to bring in people that can be members. So what we what we learned very early on in San Antonio is our first marketing company. I caught them on Google with a really wide radius so you looked at the map of San Antonio where our members lived and it was a shotgun. It was literally everywhere and we had a hard time retaining those members because if you have to drive 30 minutes to get to a goal. You're not going to keep your membership very long so it's it's really important that we keep that targeted even with events. I've had to go back and talk to my event person like hey you didn't event at this gym across town. That's not going to be a long term member our lifetime values over a thousand dollars in San Antonio even at our lower price point and average length of membership is 14 months. So that's really great that we have to make sure we're bringing in the people that can retain a membership over a long period of time. So what was working in February when we got the highest number of foot traffic from Google ads that we've ever had before. Yeah, so I think what's been a pain point for us the last two to three months is they started pulling back on those search campaigns. They got focused on just like cost for bringing somebody in. But you know we you know always if somebody's searching for our services we want to play in that game. I don't think they were being creative enough on the actual ads for those search campaigns. They've also never. They said that YouTube was ineffective for them. I think they just don't have any experience with it and we were just getting a really poor. And you know offering for that. So I think my gut right now is that we need to pull back on our meta budget. You know we've exhausted that audience for the last two years. That's where the budget primarily was. I think we need to limit that maybe try new things try new retargeting focus a little bit more potentially on either. And so we have a lot of energy. So we've been trying to make sure that we're not going to have a lot of tech talk which we've never you know really played around with. And YouTube but also making sure that our search campaigns are optimized because we're losing to competitors that shouldn't even be anywhere in our realm. We did just start doing. What is it user generated content where one of us so our social media person in house test. We're doing some ads through her account and we're also going to start that through our GM's account because they have really robust followings and they're willing to do that. So I was going to say teacher. Could be a book. Oh my I don't know if you have discovered a TikTok actually works very well. And especially for content that like the the coal plants campaign had like hundred people side up right. So that's a one time thing. It may not make sense. To run the campaign again because he's spanned expires right you did the event like 10 years ago or maybe two months ago. But TikTok is a medium where you can take piece of a content and you can revive it. You can reposition it. It's just whatever say take a piece of it make a small TikTok and push it again. So that content can be giving you more attention over the time. It's just after you you have to be creative and after slice out which part of the video like again. Like again, compression 10 minute video into like 30 seconds. Oh I think we lost him. And just trying to have this video I think. I'm sorry. I was just just excited. So what else can I say? Especially the services that both and involved offers their huge view on short, reals and TikTok. Instagram is a good thing but people who comes to search a real customer. That's like one tear of your customer. People who discover you that would be Twitter and YouTube in my opinion. Because we see this every day in our business. TikTok and YouTube is the YouTube is a long-term investment. TikTok is a short-term investment. That's how you see it. If you want quick attention you stick to if you want long-term credibility you see it. That's not the market works. Facebook gives you traffic. You bring traffic with Facebook because Facebook tends to change their algorithm every week. So whatever works to it doesn't work tomorrow. Facebook knows their business. YouTube knows their picture also knows their picture. So they're all kind of knows which type of audience they capture. For a business you need to have regular Google presence. You need to have regular Facebook presence. And you need to have a long-term goal with YouTube. Short-term goal with TikTok. That's it. Whatever content you create can be repurposed every platform. So if you run a campaign today maybe there's a campaign is over on Facebook. But I can take the content. Make it a short 30 second, 60 second clip with the sound bit with whatever tempo. And post it on TikTok. That means you can resell the same content in multiple channels. It depends on obviously if you're still targeting their audience. But I think this is how the whole thing should be connecting together. New audience, how should the new audience be targeted? How should the old audience be reachar-gated? How should you build loyalty? All this should be within the content plan. Not just only posting ads. Yeah. Totally agree. Chase for your say something. Okay. I was just agreeing with the TikTok thing. I definitely agree. I think TikTok's a really good thing. Yeah. I see that stuff on Marlottom. Yeah, I think it's a good opportunity. I think it's a good opportunity. I think it's a good opportunity. I'm just going to bring awareness. For sure. I see. Yeah. Yeah. So I heard meta ads somewhat exhausted. Black and creativity. Practice of keeping geo targeting online and we're teaching to try more on YouTube and TikTok. What else needs to be managed? Yeah. The Google ads they turned the search campaigns back on. But I think those could use a tune-up and make sure they're using the correct words. I'll probably go in there. I can't. And I'm dangerous enough I can play around, but I don't know the strategic back end. And you know, potentially what are the things we need to do on the website so that those Google search campaigns are more effective. And just one more quick thing that is starting to kind of start to look like a good option is we're meeting with all today. So what I'm starting to see is kind of like what you guys are doing, Isaiah, if we've got a local team on the ground that can help us capture content and keep things fresh and new and that but I don't fully trust them on for the back end. They're tech knowledge to me feels like a little concerning of actually operating the back end of these ads on Google and meta. So I see you guys as obviously very strong on the tech side and the content you know editing and whatnot. So what I'm thinking is if we can get all of the locations where they're working with all for content, especially during the pre-opening phase and then ongoing, they're handing that information off to you guys where y'all are managing the campaigns. Back to me, works off of everybody's strengths and if we can get everybody doing the same thing, then there's going to be cross-pollination and also makes our lives a little bit easier. And I would say two, I think one of the biggest struggles since we were working with y'all is like, yeah, I think part of it is now we're at your three and so you know, growing at this point is just a little bit. But we also like the creative side, we don't expect green pants to do the creative but give us feedback about what you need is what we always ask. Like is there footage that you're wanting or there words that you're wanting to like, you all are the ideas that you all are the experts in this space and we can like we don't have that feedback. So you know what you're looking for. Not performing. Yeah, you know what works. You guys can tell all directly like, all right, we need a video of somebody going from the Copeland Sonnen red light because we're going to run this ad and then that can happen quick enough. They seem pretty responsive. They've also got creative ideas, the part of their philosophy, which I do kind of agree with is if something works well organically on social media, that's potentially a good ad because people are if we see that people are responding to it, then let's figure out a way to turn that into a sneaky ad that they don't really see come and go ahead and run. Yeah. So I was going to cut you on that. So we try to keep 20% of our time within the work budget for new for discovery, like the one you mentioned, right. I can keep throwing ads every day. It's going to be a bit. I read both. It's going to be everything. You learn that. So what we do try to add 15 to keep 15 to 20% to generate new ideas. So just three category that we use to generate new ideas. Number one is the content. So we find all the synonyms, all the catchphrases, the prefix and suffix of sauna, cold plants. So that's the recurring thing. You may discover a new town, new word, tomorrow there is associated with sauna. Right. So that's what the content is. It's a regular thing. It has to be a weekly thing that we add to our grocery, with our dictionary of terms. Then we need to do research. Like a regular research on keywords which keywords is popping up on Google. You go, you pop them around. So then you can target those keywords more accurately. And the third part is basically generating lots of lots of content. So as I said, search engine values you by the content density. The drug values you buy your trend. So tick talk. For example, today maybe something called Tesla is very going trendy. So tick talk knows which content user wants to watch. And they push that content organically. So you can save a lot of money if you can write one of those organic trend. That's what we try to write on. If you can catch one ride, that's going to give you like million moment of that you can ever buy. You can never buy that momentum. So we always try to figure out a niche. Always try to catch one of the trend. Like if you can catch one trend every six months, that's like million dollar miles there you can never buy with money. So this is a regular thing that we try to incorporate with the network of it. Okay, that totally makes sense. I think the struggle in the past was that one of our creatives was trying to get us to do trending things on Instagram. And we're really not about that. But I'm open to doing that for tick talk, right? Because it is a quicker fast review. And some of the, we can, we could ask some of our influencers to do that if there are already doing tick talk trendy things to just incorporate an evolved trend. Yeah. I was just a real quick. What am I issues with the company that we're leaving is that they were responsive when there were issues with the campaigns not proactive. So that's why I really, I was not in my head a lot to 20% should always be testing new things because if you're not prepared for the new, the, what's going to replace what's eventually going to stop working, they're all going to stop working. But they were always coming to us like, okay, this quit working. Now let's try and create something new. So we were always kind of more responsive rather than proactive. So I really appreciate that proactive thing. Like you, it's going to have to change constantly. And that's the hard thing about marketing is you have to, you have to constantly be testing and trying new things. And then when something works, hammer it until it doesn't work anymore. So thank you for that. That's, that's good to hear. Go ahead, I did. Okay, sorry, I'm going to do the thing that I usually do. What else to manage now that absolutely can't drop? Do we need to make sure we're taking on? They really weren't doing that much. They were actually like, I mean, we're meeting with them every two weeks and they gave us, they were good communicators. I just think they, they weren't as savvy and like I said proactive about. And they really couldn't do any content creation. So they would be like, all right, now we need to do a campaign, go get some content. And we, we really haven't had a good success with content creators in San Antonio. Test is starting to step up. But I would say, yeah, clear directives on what you need now too. So it's really just what, what can't drop now is the Google, like, paid advertising. That's the, the bulk of the things things we can dream about in the future are of course expanding that. But I think expanding that meaning like the website right. And we can even for now, if we want to start looking at YouTube, certainly we can start TikTok immediately. We've got that channel stood up. Possibly. We have an old channel. Yeah, we do, no, we have a YouTube channel. So what's, and I'll give you a little background. This actually probably be helpful is the offer. Since we're established, it's very different from what we're doing for round rock, which is purely talking about memberships because, you know, the goal for round rock is selling founders memberships. That's everything. So we actually kind of hide the idea of day passes because we don't want them thinking, like, oh, I'll just wait and buy a day pass when they get open. So we try to avoid that conversation because we need those founders memberships. Whereas in San Antonio and Dallas, and by the way, we would be talking about Dallas as well because the company YOL is handling both campaigns. So it would be switching for both. And I can have that conversation with Kurt and do an introduction. But the important thing is we've tried a lot of different offers to see what drives traffic. And while we want to get as many feet in the door with day passes as we can, we also want those to be the right type of person that will potentially have a membership. So first thing we tested was free day passes. And that was kind of early on just to get as much traffic as we could. But what we saw was that did tend to bring entire kickers that couldn't even afford a membership. So it was, you know, not that we mind giving away a day pass to get an opportunity to membership, but that didn't bring in the best type of client. We tried by one, get one free, that didn't track as well. And then we tried 50% off. And we're currently just stating a discounted day pass price. Seems to be the leading offer for ads in general. So we'll just say kind of like half off 2450 is the offer. We would even be open to maybe if it just makes it sound easier like $20 for your first day pass. Because we need them to have some kind of a buy-in. We know they can afford to at least pay $20 for a day pass. And then we want them to, and then our cruise job in the spaces to convert that to a membership. Why don't we do any ads for like a half off your first membership? Which have to be that yet, yeah. Okay. Okay. What case, we have to give it all. Yeah. What case of posting? Yeah, what case of posting on Instagram and other social is the current case? Yeah, for Instagram, we shoot for two to three times a week. And for Facebook, I think she just, you know, we've got an employee that's managing the organic content at least. And she does a pretty good job. She has a marketing background. But as far as ads, I'm not really, I'm not really sure how often they're changing that. And, you know, to be, to say that back to you, we don't need to take responsibility for organic on Instagram and Facebook. No, I think we've got that covered. Yeah. Okay. Don't worry about organic at all, I say, we've got, we also have an intern for the summer through a program here in Santa. So we typically have in marketing interns in the summer who help us capture content. They already sent over to more videos. Okay. Great. So not taking responsibility for Instagram and Facebook, organic. And everything. Okay. That's right. It's the same for Dallas, too. Isaiah. Dallas, person who does all their organic content. So you wouldn't have to worry about that. That's where we say, like, if you have direction or guidance about what you want us to capture that would help with ads, we can do that. That's great. And so, so, Im Ron and Chase, I hope you're hearing this really clearly. It's like, we can give them a shot list, right? We can give them a backlog of creative to make. But we don't have to come up with it all. What I'm picturing also is bringing all to the picture is if we, if we limit what they're having to do, like, they're not having to run the ads because I just don't have confidence for them. You guys obviously are much higher level for actually running the ads. But since they can be our on the ground team to get some of that more polished content. Like, if we need higher level content for YouTube that's going to be that long term building confidence in the brand expert content, that type of stuff, I can get with them. We can, you know, we can get content from them over the board. So what I'm seeing is paying a monthly fee to all, that's a little bit smaller, just to get continuous content generation. Local team does the in-house day to day posting. And then you guys are running all of the ads, SEO, YouTube, strategy, all that kind of stuff. And I would just share two though, I say, like, we were very impressed with what Green pants can do with raw footage and cutting and all of that. So also would be open if there's bandwidth for that from you all for the occasional like video if you're able to put something together because those have been everything you're going to the ground rock has been beautiful. Yeah, would you just want to be able to drive more content to you also you can, as Immer on saying, like, let's create a lot more so that we can get a lot more out there because it is, I mean, Gary V says it all the time, it's a volume thing. So that's, that's, that's the only reason that I think alt can be helpful is we can just drive more content, maybe some higher quality content that you guys can cut up and use however you need. So on the topic of Dallas, Centenonia and Round Rock, I'm trying to look at how do we bundle or how do we help each other be most effective across these stacks when you're all thoughts on that? Yeah, it's, it's a little bit tricky because this basis looks slightly different, but I actually sent alt to Dallas so that we could capture some footage of Dallas because Round Rock is going to look more like Dallas than San Antonio and especially if you're talking about a massage chair and you've got a tight shot, it doesn't matter which location is, but I think at some point when we're talking more about the different locations, you know, if Kurt does a really great video where he's talking about red light, but it's in Dallas, I think we can still use that in San Antonio and Round Rock and just kind of lean into the idea that we've got, we're a bigger brand. We've got three locations open and then Austin will be right behind y'all for locations. And we're kind of picturing a hub where the good content can be put so that y'all can access it and there is some of that cross migration of ideas and content which I think just makes everybody's brand look better, everybody's location look better. I think one of the interesting things about this too is when it comes to the analytics side, I'm sure all the owners would love the prevention marking, you know, what's working and what's not and seeing the same in all of it, right? So that's why everybody working under one company. And by the way, so we pay for like each location, they can pay green pants directly. That's why we've been doing it for y'all. The better thing is having to go through the franchise, we may do that at some point if this goes well, just you'll know what I'm picturing is, green pants basically becomes our, we can even make it required marketing company so that everybody is on the same page. Y'all know we don't usually like to require stuff, but if this is going really well and we want to take a variable off the table for franchisees, there's marketing is about the most important thing that we can do because we know how to run a facility. Marketing is just it's constantly changing and it's a variable that can make her break a location. So if, you know, if this goes well, we want the sure thing where we say we've got in-house marketing and if that needs to come through the franchise or if it goes directly y'all, that's the vision long term. And Isaiah for that, I'll share because you mentioned benchmarking, I think something to just be aware of is that Dallas is very not very involved at all. And there's we manage that. Share me in high room, sit in on those meetings and then Kurt does get a report, but he is not an in the weeds person at all. He will have some, he'll have some feedback or some questions, but he's, it's really not something that's on his plate and we're very opposite owner's on. Yes, yeah, we're incredibly opposite, which is why we are so excited about working with you in Sam too, is because yeah, it's very, and I'll say to for Austin, the, Austin O'Kill location that's coming on, Brian will likely not be very involved either. So we will be driving it like we, you, you in green pants and the franchise will really be driving that. So benchmarking is important for us and we are keeping eyes on it, but our, our disease, our other disease are not super involved in it. Just so, yeah, wherever that plans. Yes, yes, that's very helpful. Okay, so what conversion metrics you were talking about day passes and then I was also just wondering why the pack versus how you measure thoughts or lead or other trigger points in the funnel, what are the ones that you pay it and cheat you? Yeah, I mean, I think cost for acquisition is, you know, is a good metric to look at, because I, you know, what I would like to have seen more from previous companies we work with is is really charting out, you know, what is it costing on each channel and then what, but, you know, you can't focus too much on that. Like I said, they basically took Google search out because it was costing more, but that doesn't mean that it's not one of the tools that we have to use. You know, outside of that, you know, volume is still important. We need to, you know, when they're working well, by the way, Dallas does about 25% better than San Antonio, like at the same budget, they'll get a lot more leads per add their cost per acquisition is lower. So we, we really need to get back San Antonio back. We've, we've hit numbers of like 60 to 80 in San Antonio and when they dropped off, we, we saw like 20 last month and I think a big part of that was they took down the, the search ads, you know, obviously, we need to get back to those higher numbers. And as far as my location, I will keep driving more money toward it. If we see this stuff working consistently, we just, we, we saw this roller coaster of inconsistency from them and it, it makes us timid when it comes to adspin. So I go ahead and run. I was going to, I was just anxious to tell you something here. So cost per acquisition actually a magic number because you can be tactical with it. How you don't need to spend a lot of money every time. So I can have a range of cact like, for example, I would only pay 20 cents. So the Google will know when to push your hands. If it's not fully important, you don't need to push it to a higher beat because it's a RDB system real time beating. So all ads system or RDB, the beat for ad position every single second. Right. So now let's say we decided to push air in the morning. So I don't need to pay a lot of money at the evening or maybe at the night night 10. It depends on my strategy. You can have a range of expenditure and say I'm not going to pay more than 30 cents. Fine. You said that number, Google will pull. All right. Well, we wait on him. How do you want us to manage ad spend ups and downs? What's the range there? I like to keep the spend pretty consistent. It's just if we have somebody that's a little bit more responsive. Oh, and then he's gone cheaper ads. I just would like a like we need a few more outlets. So basically they were just relying, you know, three quarters of the budget on Instagram and Facebook and then Google was kind of like an afterthought. If we have, you know, a few more. Sorry, I'm run you, you froze on us. I'll let you finish your thought though. So I was going to say, I don't know how much you had said I was going to say you can plan your expense. Right. So if you don't want to spend a lot of cash, you can plan your spend less than 30 cents or one dollar. So you can position your ad and ask Google to only display ad when the cost feeds so much in. So, you know, Google is an RTB system as I said, it's a real time feeding system. So whatever margin you put at, Google will run your ad when the margin hits your range. Right. So you can control it. Second thing you should reserve some budget for highly crowded market like a Christmas, like a new year season. Like, oh, you know, you need to invest all of a pack. So this is what I'm going to say, if you say, you can see, then fine, don't go into the expensive tier play with the non expensive side. So you run your ad in the morning, run your ad in the evening. So that's the like low price strength timing for your ad. So you can time and budget based on your urgency, based on your need for attention. Second thing I was going to say, if you measure cost per acquisition, you have to measure lifetime value too. So how do you know, acquisition is worthless. You don't know how it is a lifetime bill. A customer could be paying you $10,000 over lifetime, but maybe you're spending too much to who are the customer right now. So you never know if it's too much or too low, unless you have a measurement way. Right. So most one is most companies try to measure in two year or three year lifetime value, right, because you know, if a customer moves out of Texas or somehow gets married or whatever reason. So let's say three year lifetime value, you can calculate. If you have that number, KAC actually doesn't make make that sense, right? Third measure, I'm going to say is run a low profile ad all the time. So try to catch low budget traffic. So there are slots in a two in different times when we actually have a low budget ad. Find those low budget time and try to run those ads on your low budget period. So you don't have to always spend a lot of money. That's what I'm trying to say. Right. Yeah, and I'm not sure if if you're on when I was saying, I don't mind putting more budget to things, but we just want to see a little bit more consistency and I think having more channels, you know, so that if we need to shift budget from one to the other, you know, I prefer to give you all that bandwidth, you know, where we say like the budget is $3,500 a month, where are we getting the best, you know, again, like let's not turn off search ads because that's also we're competing for that. So I don't want to hand somebody a lead for a sauna customer just because, you know, we we tapped out on a certain budget. So it's funny. I actually told the previous company like, make sure we've got enough so that we don't stop showing up and then they somehow turn that into turning it off. But, you know, that's a competition, you know, if we if we pull out for for that competition, we just made it cheaper for them to get a guest, you know, from a sauna search. So that's why I don't know. It's I don't know if I'm just bullish on that. Does that make sense to you as a like, okay, yeah, it just, it's no common sense to me. I don't know what happened, but you know, you know, Google, Google has over 200 places where you can not just search even search as a multiple layer of display center. It's a desktop, mobile, Android, Play Store, Gmail, you just have like 200 plus positions you can play with, right? So it's not always that straightforward. Yeah. If I was there, I'm going to pick five positions and I'll see which position works better. I'm going to change those five position every month. See, which position actually brings you the right customer, right? So it's not a single thing like Google, I had Google search. It's actually a beta sting over all the placement, Google offers, and see which placement actually brings you most of it. Yeah. And start date for this Isaiah, what also be July one, right? Or, well, no, or then like they're they're done at the end of the month, but I would rather be a little bit of overlap so that you guys have a runway, you know, we could get started. And whenever next week, I'll give you a full access so that you can see what's currently operating it. It should give you some historic data on both meta and Google Adwords. And then by the time they're done, you guys can, you know, push forward the new ideas or whatnot. But I'd rather there be some overlap so that we're, you know, we don't have a dead period. That's perfect. Yeah, because our first task will be get our hands around the tools, analyze them, see what we think creatively, but then we also need to have a brief like, did you already try that period? You know, because I don't ever want to pull off an idea that you already did. Mm-hmm. Yeah, we can definitely. And yeah, one more thing is that next couple of months as Jan and I told you, we'll be doing a lot of evitesting. So everything we do, we'll have multiple copies. Every ad we'll have three copies, every campaign we'll have three copies. So because we don't, we are very sure that we don't, we are not leaving anything out. The more tests you are, the more discovery is actually free research. You don't have to work on it. You just throw three types of ads, see which one picks up. And we will do this continuously in a couple of months. So that you figure out how much budget, for example, out of the three or 3500 budget, you can fix 70% on proven channels, proven positions. You can keep the 30% on experimental channels where it is called new ways where you can run the ad. So you cannot like you shouldn't always run the ad on known channels. How do you discover new channels? You do only spend on new areas, right? That sounds perfect. Okay. Well, you go back to my list. I had one more big and oh yeah, I have two big ones. Continue on the analytics side. I don't often do you take it reports in what are you looking at now? They would, so we would meet with the previous marketer, every two weeks, higher than I would get on. And they would mostly go over the the budget per channel. So it was basically broken up for meta and Google. They would tell us the amount spent and the number of conversions that we had. So not super, super in depth. I wouldn't mind. I like the data. So I don't get overwhelmed by it. So that would be great if we could meet with your team every two weeks and the like Courtney sent. We kind of operate Dallas for them. In the sense that we're trying to optimize it and it's something they don't have to mess with everybody wins in that scenario. We just want all locations growing. So we're happy to invest the time. And also, we use brand fund strategically. Like brand fund for us, like we're not running national ads. So sometimes we've done it like we just paid all to go to Dallas to get content from there. And we use brand fund for that because brand fund should directly benefit each individual location. Until we can run a Texas wide ad or something like that, which is still pretty far out. We want you guys. We want that money to be directly beneficial. So there's, of course, it's not huge. San Antonio pays into it and Dallas, but especially once you're running, that can be part of the conversation. But, you know, we just want to see what you're peeking in it. Yeah, every two weeks looking at the numbers kind of seeing where it's spending. Oh yeah, we got about 10 minutes. So talking about retention marketing. Yeah. Yeah. You know, with the op spec, we, part of the reason we like it is it keeps our, our guests and leads organized. Pushpress just doesn't really have a process for that. Once they're in pushpress, we consider them like a one customer because they get pushed over there. But op spec or what's the other name for it? Go high level. Yeah, that's what I say. And I was at as we can do target. We can do retargeting through email or text. And so we're, we're still trying different things in there. But I know we can upload those lists either from, from either channel where we can drop that into meta or Google and say like, hey, these are like, I've had no for it for sure. We've done like members. So we know these are people that are that long term gold standard client. Let's use that in meta. I don't know how well that was used, but I know that was a strategy that we discussed. Yeah, Emma. I was going to, I was going to say retargeting an email in texting definitely works. But can we be liberty? No, we have with this prep for example, if you know a customer came to use six months ago, can we just send a text here if you're in a book a 10 minute consultancy with us, just give us an opportunity. So ask them to have a consultancy like, how was your experience? Do you need this support? So is it possible to mix up like five minutes in a week or five minute free consultancy, five minute free support with very tension? Yeah. And we do have Liz who follows up with guests. So if somebody came in and used the day pass, but they did not convert to a membership, they're going to get a phone call so that we have another opportunity and she, she does fairly well with that. Well, we're about to stand up for retention. One for new members. So during their first 30 days, they're going to get a text. They're going to get some follow up emails so that they understand the importance of creating the habit. But we're also, as a dialysis doing this, and we're about to start is doing an offer for folks who cancel like six months ago, they canceled their membership, giving them an offer for half off their first month back with us. So we'll see how that works. What is the, just asking, is there any cancellation funnel right now active? If somebody wants to cancel? No, they don't plan. We don't have, well, we have a, we do have a they can downgrade. So if somebody's the most, the number one reason for cancelations is I'm not able to make it to, I'm not able to use services as often. I was, as I would like. And so we tried to get them to downgrade. We even have a completely off menu plan where the lowest plan is four a month, but we're offering downgrading to two a month. It hasn't proven, it hasn't saved anybody yet. So we're probably going to just do away with that. But that's the main thing. Summer for us in San Antonio, we see some because we have a lot of teachers or seasonal folks who come with us. And so we're, we're thinking about a summer plan. Some flexibility there. But yeah, we don't have any cancel. We don't, we don't have a contract and we don't have any fees. So, you know, yeah, we try not to make it terribly difficult for people to cancel, but they do have one hoop they have to jump through where they have to fill out a form. Because we want to be able to win them back. But you can't just make it a button on their app, you know, it's, it makes a banana website. Hey, that I have now exhausted. I request some thank you. Anyone else? Something they want to ask for to say. I think, yeah, we, we, it will be helpful for us to do some research because pastoral, from my site, my team would be doing a lot of content research with Isaiah and the and Chase will be doing a lot of messaging and fixing up a grocery for you. So grocery is the most important, but I believe because you need to find a lot of synonyms for the same word. Let's have Google works. Yeah. You have to cover all the basics. There's no other is. And I'm going to say we need to come up with some fixing methodology for the website because a lot of the traffic will come into website and maybe find a way to reach them back later. And set up a, we, we call a growth stack. So you'll connect the growth stack to your system, like to your website to your Facebook. So there we can see everything coming in. And this process would give us a really personalized experience of how we should start investing your money on it. I did think of something that'll be relevant for you guys. We've also tried two different things for leads coming in. So, for, in order for them to make a purchase, they have to go directly to, or they need a land on push press where they, they basically put in their name, phone number, email, and then buy that day pass. So that has to be, that's the conversion. We've tried two different things where they either go to a landing page where they can gather more information. And then there's a purchase now link on there. Or a lot of times we haven't just go straight to the, the purchase page. There's two theories there. You know, you add an extra click if you have them go to the landing page, but they gain more information. If they go straight to the purchase page, they may click off because they don't have enough information. So we're, we're kind of, you know, again, that's a, a, a, a, a, a testing type thing. My current understanding, high-rump might have more information on this is that we saw slightly better, only a little bit better conversion when they went straight to the purchase page. Because so we can do either one. And I believe we have conversion tracking with either a post purchase page or something like that, but, you know, there's a, right after the purchase. Yeah, there's a green direct. So we can, we can provide that. Who the pixels are whatnot. But we can track it Google and everywhere. This is a conversion tracking is available everywhere. What I was going to say is that we check out extremely important. I know you know Amazon does it very well. Because the longer time you make the maker customer with the longer it gets the, the chance of getting it, it's checking out is very risky. So he has to be there whenever customer is thinking about it, the first situation should check out. Yeah, he's the best way. That's what we've seen. So yeah, as a, if you all could put together a quote, again, I can Dallas should be very easy, but we'd probably just do an introduction call so they can meet Jolens. But if they, they follow our lead on that type of stuff and other than that, and we'll kind of same with float. Oh, we're y'all waiting on this for anything for float. Okay, just make sure. But yeah, I mean, I think we're excited because I feel like y'all are going to be a huge upgrade. And I also like that you'll get an insight into what it's going to be like after you open. So y'all can be prepared because it's, it's a very different, you know, the campaigns and the strategy, everything shifts to a different mode once you're open. And it becomes entirely day passes. You know, we still want to drop in membership awareness so that they come in. They, they know that's going to be part of it. But I think this will really help you all on the next phase because you'll already have some insights. And I think you're going to help us grow faster. San Antonio, you know, we're really frustrated the last few months, you know, with the lack of leads, you know, if you don't have foot traffic, you, you can't grow. So we're ready to turn the spick it back on. Got our crew closing well right now. So we just need to get them more leads. Perfect. I love everything about this. Thank you all for trusting us. And yeah, we're, we're working hard to build the right proposals here and we'll have that for your next. Sounds great. You'll have a great weekend. Thanks y'all. Nice to meet you. Bye bye.

 So kind of place you go through Number two, yeah So we're doing I'm matriculating my way over to Huntsville, Texas today because today is debate coaching day at the prison that I coach out for rehabilitation. So I'm meeting actually the other guy who coaches with me. He was a former champion debater and he works at an AI company here as their top salesperson. So we're meeting up in Elgin to a carpool or else Yeah, because you're like, you don't want to have to drive everyone separately any further than that. Yeah, so Are you all expecting Courtney today? Before we kick off or should we go ahead and get this party started? I'm not sure Jeremy are yet. Yes, I know. I'm not at the kitchen table today, so I normally have to be a bit of a turn until you. Sorry, I didn't realize my audio was it on. Yeah, no court's not going to not be meeting with us. I'll be on screen, but I can hear you guys. Great. Okay. Well There we go. Let's go ahead and get started. We are just so delighted to welcome you all to work with you and we got this whole team here ready to listen and in taking it started. We scheduled this meeting to be fast because you had some pain and problems around ads. And so I want you to meet some of your team real quick and then let's jump straight into ads. So Chase, if you don't mind running some intro for a second of yourself and I want to make sure they understand that you and us here are both going to be taking a lot of responsibility in the ad area so I will make sure they hear a little bit about each of you. Go ahead Chase. Hey guys, Jeremy, I know I've met you before. Good to see you. Here you are. Is that how you say your name? Hi, Ram. Yeah. Great to meet you. I'm Chase. I do growth kind of management here at Green Pass. So I manage all the different growth projects. Make sure kind of our team is staying on pace and I also like to get down and dirty and actually work on the different projects as well. So I'll be helping a Seer Hill talk in a second and do some self. I'll be helping them specifically with your. Google and meta ads. Making sure those are optimized, especially making sure that we're just getting. Lots of lead flow through there is going to be the goal. To actually kind of convert those ads into actual memberships as much as we can. We know you guys had some problems with the past agencies and their creativity and so it's our job to make sure that we are creative and we're making things actually happen for you guys. So yeah, that's a little bit about me. A Seer if you would like to introduce yourself to the guys and tell them a little bit about what you do that'd be great. Your thanks, Chase. Hi, herum and Jeremy. I must say nice to meet you guys. So I actually I am in performance marketing in the last six years. I do performance marketing in Bangladesh, especially, but I have a lot of experience with Google ads, meta ads, LinkedIn ads, etc. So I all I ran almost a million dollars ads in a month while I was at agency called ADA, as you know, digital Bangladesh. So there I handed around 20 plus brands in that agency. Now I am working in a startup called Jatri, this travel tech company and I am working as a performance marketing manager here. And in Kenshin, my part is to be the perfect growth and performance manager to actually help our client grow their business with the help of the apps. Thanks, Seer. And then the next person, I don't know if you guys have met him or not, but Gideal, he does quite a bit of management on the growth team as well. Making sure everyone's kind of aligned is kind of what his job is. So Gideal, if you want to introduce yourself. Yeah, sure, thanks, Chase. Hi, Thames. My name is Gideal. So basically, I'm working as a head of products and so I work with a lot of companies in my last few years, like I worked as a head of products at several companies. So especially I work on the product's part. So I manage products management and also working on the EI first. In a can think, so basically I managed evolved roundrock projects. So especially in growth growth management and media parts and instead is it parts and those things I managed right now. So that's the thing, sexually. That's what I call that. Jenny, the poster that you both ran as a video you saw was kind of a concoctioned people from Gideal and I see them. They are on the ignition. That was my hearst. Awesome. Cool. And have you both met Emron? I know Jeremy has. Yeah. Okay, great. Okay. Well, Emrons are, you make everything happen. So you guys already know that. Very cool. Awesome. Well, here's my super professional background now. Sorry. Jeremy, we are ready. However, you want to start this to hopefully see some stuff on screens and you talk us through the fixes you've made and where it needs to go. And we'll start asking questions. Yeah. So I'll give you a brief history of what we've done in the past. I think, you know, what we can obviously you guys are the experts in the technical side of things and content creation thing break. That was a big part of why we decided to bring pants as we immediately saw some really beautiful assets from you guys. That was a shortcoming of our previous agency. They, I think they did a decent job in Meta, but I'll be curious to see you. Y'all feel free to share. Good and bad that you see once you get in these systems. I think they were really lacking in the Google ad side. I think they did a decent job in Meta, but I also feel like they kind of exhausted Meta for us. So I'll get into a little bit about the history of what we've done in the past that we felt like was successful in what kind of crash and burn. Because we've done a lot of A B testing to try and understand what's the best way to get folks into evolve. And so I'll start with that that generally what we're seeking is foot traffic into the physical location. At least for for open locations. Now round rock obviously is different. We're trying to build awareness around the brand and and sell founders memberships. So we really for anything that's that's pre-opening. We don't actually talk about day passes hardly at all. We actually kind of want to avoid the conversation around a day pass because we're focusing our entire energy on selling memberships for pre-open locations. So round rock's going to be a different strategy, but I think the cool thing about y'all working with the mall in San Antonio is you can start to plan for once round rock is open. And how that strategy kind of it literally shifts overnight from. Membership founders memberships to day pass sales. So in San Antonio initially we tried actually just free day passes because the the financial benefit of a day pass is negligible compared to for is a small amount compared to. What we get for memberships currently in San Antonio our membership our average customer link is 14 months. And the average lifetime value is is over $1100 now it kind of keeps going up. So again our our end goal is to get somebody signed up for a membership. It's a little challenging to we we really have a test of too much it's a little challenging to get people to sign up for. And the partnerships when the spaces open we founders obviously you've got the full mow and you've got you know the incentives there but for an existing location we find it easier to get people in. To experience it and then that crew in the space is their job is to sign up get the get the guests to sign up for a membership. So we initially tried three day passes but what we found was that brought in a. And so we found a little bit of a set of our little bit too low and it brought in some folks that really weren't financially. Am able to purchase a membership or they just wanted the free thing so we we proved we moved away from that strategy. We've tried full price and that really just didn't bring in enough guests. We tried by one get one free and that also just didn't really really move the traffic so we've actually. The main thing is the half off day passes been seems to be the sweet spot and we're still open to new ideas so if you guys have a thought or an idea please we're always we generally say the best. The best idea wins so if there's another way we can slice this as far as offers we're open to ideas but currently what seems to have worked the best in the past which brings in a decent caliber of guests. But also somebody you know enough traffic is the half off day pass now we can we can spend that as twenty four dollars and fifty cents or half off. I remember I think the actual dollar amount did better than the fifty percent off. It did yeah fifty percent off is fifty percent off of what was kind of the question and people didn't realize we were talking. So cheap about spa services so like the twenty four fifty really made a lot of eyes pop and they like that a lot better. Conversion rate would it just work better overall. I've had an idea for something where we show the day pass price and then like it slashes through that and then shows the half off because if we can if we can express both of the ideas like one this is a great offer. And also it's only twenty four fifty which is a really small amount for for what we're offering that might be a full idea we haven't tried it. But that again that came back to content creation where we didn't have a good team that could do that that would probably be very easy for y'all. Just a pop in there another thing that's like the lead to that journey was the idea that we were about to launch we left the last one that was like this can be used towards your membership. And that's what we do in the lab anyway and we've never told people that and the outset. So being able to communicate again we need to create a that can deliver that so glad to be talking with y'all about this. But having having that communicated to the end user that this isn't just a day fast to go try it out you want to use this towards your membership you can do that to. Yeah, and we think that would be a great idea because we want to start to plant the idea of a membership like at least make them aware that this is a membership model. Anyway, we can of course the focus is on here's the offer it's a very low price and here's what you get with that which can be part of the challenge. And so to speak specifically to the platforms. I'm personally a big fan of Google search. I think if a guest or somebody in our area is searching for something we do that's a great opportunity. I was just in there putting in negative keywords to make sure that you know those those terms don't broaden out too far so. I'm very open to having really detailed conversations about what those should and shouldn't be because it's I realize that coming into this sphere is is very unique and the wellness industry isn't isn't like other things. So I would actually prefer more communication on what those add say that the big pain point we've had in the past is. I think that's a great idea. I think that's a great idea. I think that's a great idea. Sometimes we and so if they're too far away. They're not going to be coming in regularly maybe if they work but so we generally try and keep that geographic. Area pretty tight. The most I really would like to see in San Antonio is 15 miles if we're just exhausting a group but 10 miles would be ideal if we can spread it out over more channels. Again, we see that people cancel because they're not coming in and so if we can if we can keep them closer in proximity then they're more likely to visit regularly and keep their membership. So we yeah we had we fired our first marketing company because we found out they were using a geographic area of literally hundreds of miles and they just they just punch the wrong. But in Google AdWords, but it cost a thousand dollars and ads that didn't need to be served. I recently found that the company we were just working with they have the entire city of Dallas showing for Dallas is Google ads and they acknowledge that it was a mistake but. You know that could be a 30 45 minute drive for somebody on the other side of Dallas and. Those kind of mistakes it's just you know it's taking the time to set things up properly and then going back and checking they also had keywords that had been left in there. Since they're opening things like get a founders membership, I found you know somewhere tucked away in a Google ad that they never needed and Google may not be showing that term but those kind of things can really get under my skin because I'll go in there and check and and that tells me that the ads aren't being. The main tanger or updated regularly. And as far as meta, I feel like in San Antonio, we got to a point where they were seeing the ads four or five times and obviously that's that's not great. So we we've recently kind of pulled back on the budget for that and I'm kind of feeling like we could lean into Google in YouTube. And actually just the last few days that started running ads on TikTok and the cost for click and the number of views that it's showing are. Pretty high so I don't know if that's anything you'll play around with but I might just I might just play around with it a little bit on my own to see how that looks and then we can discuss it later. So sorry, there's a common in the chat. I was just commenting to the thing with us team to give them my idea of how far away the Dallas ads are based on their city because they also have a very large sprawled city. And I think that's worth understanding is like we actually share that here is these Texas cities San Antonio and Dallas are some of the. Largest sprawled out cities in the whole United States. Yeah, yeah, go ahead, everyone. So I think this is a very interesting one. One thought comes to my mind is that probably. I know they are not with us but this is one of the easiest way to try again. Like you know, take a chunk of geographic location and so it's. So if you do take time, like if you allow some time, like go find the right tag in because we can just use the map. Find you graphical like we call it. Nearest what is it highlighted point like the business or a bank or maybe stadium. Like is there is there an mentionable premise or entity nearby. So we if we collect through those tags and throw ads that's more precise than just targeting through geographic location. Does any you target everybody even people who are not maybe not the right customer, whatever they will see this. For example, if you just use the map like if you can see the premises right here. Right, so we if you zoom deeper in, it's just take some time to do some research. Right, if you do the research properly and build a premise like this, you're tagging business main position, sports people's behavior and put those into ad before dispatching that that it takes time. This is what I'm trying to say, it takes time to prepare it, but that gives you precise. Delivery you can literally target a building even though Facebook Google have different strategy on targeting specific premises, but you still can do that. Just different hacks around it. I see you may be able to tell me where we how do you normally target geographic location if you have a customer base. I would argue thing we can. I work on this to make sure like within ten mile radius, we have a strategy to target businesses that may be. I'm not a maybe the may have accurate audience level. How do you normally. Target businesses within the premise within a geographic location. I see. So, why if we have the customers numbers, we don't need to put the location of the customers or any geographical location. First of all, cause we already give the platform the numbers and the email address platform. We only target those users on the address. The platform will not, gonna target the other users if we are not saying the platform that reach more audience to get better results. Yeah, but there's more people. If you're to get like for example, look like audiences. How effective would be the look like audience within the premise like it was in defined area. Yes, right. So if we select the look like audience or use a single audience in Google, it will. We can target as minimum as one mile. One mile in any geographical area and it's a radius. So we cannot target any polygonal thing. So. So polygonal is not. Sorry, I just want to be really clear that Joe the goal that we're going for is to reach a new audience. We can do retargeting if say if somebody has been in and they don't have a membership. So we can get some really specific target list. But we are not trying to serve ads back to folks that have been in the facility. We've got other ways to do that. And if they've been in, we're going to have their email and phone number and we're going to use direct target re targeting through text or email. So it's really important for you guys to understand that we're trying to bring first time first time visitors into a vault. That is at least for San Antonio right now again. Roundrock is a different conversation, but for San Antonio and Dallas. It's getting people in here for the first time so they can experience it because what we do. I'm sure this has been kind of expressed to you all, but what we do is very unique. There's not any other businesses that operate in the way that we do. And so one of our challenges is getting them to understand why it's better in getting our name in front of people. And one of the biggest challenges has been helping people understand what makes it unique, which is no appointments and access to everything in the facility. All of our competitors, you basically book appointments and you pay for each service. And so it's almost so different that one of the biggest hurdles is getting people to believe the value. It's kind of a funny thing because it almost seems too good to be true. And so when we we've even tried talking about specific services rather than the big wide picture and we say, you know half off your day pass to enjoy red lights on a cold lunch. Because that's something they can wrap their head around even sometimes when we say day pass they may not really understand what a day pass is. So we're trying to think of different ways where we could say, because that's what they would pay for it. Other facility they'd spend $30 just for one red light. So I'd like to get kind of, you know, specific on that where we're saying come enjoy this and that for this price and you don't have to book an appointment. Something that's real simple like that I think where people can wrap their head around it, but again, sorry, this is a little bit of the tangent, but definitely the important thing is understand like we're trying to try to make people aware of us and bring them into the physical facility with that with that offer. And so I'm going to reflect back to you some of the constraints because this is appropriate giving us the guardrails, which is. Goal is first time. But traffic in the door. The other rest of the marketing and sales tactics can take it from there. There's a lot of room for experimentation around the messaging. So if I'm having a bunch of ideas over here, which I am, we'll we'll try some of those. And because you're category defining. We have to be able to. Innovate there and that's going to make their existing categories. Challenger question. Oh, and then finally, of course, the critical success factor of around 10 miles, a mutable driving distance is correct for people. I have one question about that. What is it 10 miles from residents work or just that they happen to be around some of the time because I understand this to be a third place. Yeah, I think 10 miles. Like they live 10 miles from our ball. Isn't that what we've usually said, Jeremy? I mean, typically I like to think of it as something they're going to go to a lot of times on a weekend. But I also don't, you know, if they work near there, there's a very good chance they could stop in after work. I mean, that's going to be a big strategy with Dell, I think. And we were talking about this on the call last week. The same is starting to actually the call with all and fam starting to really figure out ways that we can target for roundrock those Dell employees and start to create a list of either. I think Sam is going to start looking and LinkedIn like who are the shift leads or managers or leadership team there, where we can put out an offer to them and bring people in. But for this for San Antonio mostly we haven't targeted. Like work locations as much as at home, but I think it's one of those two. It doesn't have to be specific to one. And then one other question I had is I just wondered. What amount of study of the existing customers have you done on this communication problem like. An example would be for the next three days. Everybody who walks out the door if your staff isn't otherwise occupied. He just asked them, hey can I ask you really quickly. What would you say to somebody or do you say to somebody who's doing other spasor versus what makes it unique and just record that because. That to me would actually be a very ideal ad when you're struggling with the lead ability is the actual people walking in and out of the facility saying it. We have data on why they came in you know like is that's kind of like part of the intake form and we have found that 40% of guests. Have work out recovery on their radar that may not be the primary reason, but that's one of them. So that's that's the largest group by far. What was number two after that, Hiram. So and it's funny work out recovery actually is up to 70% as one of the things listed. The leading one 40% of the time that 70% of the time it's one of the ones listed on there so it's a history character yeah totally. The other is relaxation was the the next one. So like looking to go somewhere to roll acts kind of deal. It was funny I think it was like 20% of respondents said that so as you huge gap down to that and then lower from there. And it's right. And it's wrong but that's their first intake right so correct after they've done it for three or six months. It's possible like like I guess one of the things I've heard and undoubtedly. Some people feel like there's a community there. Yeah and as far as I know from most online community marketing you can't ever sell the community as actually part of a thing it's something people experience. I actually go through a cohort they're like I want to talk to these people again, but if you try to sell it up front they're like I don't need a new friends. And so that's something I'm wondering. Yeah I think we have go ahead. Yeah there's I think it's a good idea Jeremy for us to share the user experience research data that we have. We've got things that people both responded to. Surveys like actual member and visitor surveys that are not just the intake form but also like what a will did before use a general manager was like a good solid three month research study for us on how the users in the space interact with it what they're interested in what like keeps them there what would make them you know want to leave. There were a lot of things we kind of learned from that and that was you know going on the previous I would say like two years of data up until that point and including some data and Dallas do because we went up there and research there as well. Yeah and I was going to share with the the workout recovery we do partner with a lot of gems so that might be slightly skewed compared to who we're bringing in from social. I don't know how I'm if we're able to to skew like to parse out that data from where they came to us from but that would be interesting to see. We certainly good I haven't yet. Yeah. We try and captures much data as we can so we can get more precise and educated on this so if there's a question about the data that you'll have we'll see if there's a way to. I don't know what's the next question you'll have because I can just ramble on what one more before we move on is that can you share or show with us I'm just trying to actually get my hands on the thing around geography. I'm pretty sure I remember seeing some cool maps or something can you. Share or draw that for us or just you're going to share my screen and like show us what smiles looks like I think that'll help us all. I could pull up smack and real quick Jeremy and literally so that we pulled around our lab. For Santa's. Yeah. What I've seen yeah what I've seen in the as usually for either Google or meta is just doing a radius around Santa. Now if we wanted to get a little bit more precise because San Antonio is very divided as far as like income we could also get into I could create as if code list if we wanted to be slightly more precise but. I don't know if that's much better than just doing your radius because it's a lot of extra work but. That's another possibility. Look alike audiences are pretty easy because we can just send over like a member list with emails and I know at least from meta they can. Because I look alike would still be good as well as still geographically targeted I think. I like these people school but attribution is another thing we try to figure out there's a number of position people intentions jobs. Attributes also the fellow behavioral attributes those are the real filtering that can help you to narrow it down to precise audience. I just want to add something here if whenever we try to. Be very specific about our placement. They're basically raised the cost way up. Yeah so if you do bulkhead is cheaper I think that's why most people choose the bulk method of it because we need compared to any specific at cost way more than just throwing it at them. Yeah I'm good with with doing more general and not getting too targeted as long as we do the geographic thing. I agree like sometimes you you try to find people too much and I don't know that you're necessarily serving because he evolved like we said workout recovery is part of it that people come for relaxation they come to manage pain. They come to manage our brightest so there's lots of different ways they can enjoy the facility. So let's try to define them sometimes might be working against us a little bit. One thing that we ran into recently that it kind of led to us letting go of the previous provider was. They were too focused on cost for acquisition and in a feel like. Sometimes I realize that certain types of leads like they were talking specifically about Google search like if somebody searching for sauna. It was costing more than people we were getting in from meta but to me when somebody's searching for the services that we do that's that's a higher standard of client than somebody just finding it wanting to go try a thing. That's a little bit anecdotal but they literally quit running Google search ads because. They thought that they were getting cheaper results on meta and I just don't agree with that philosophy and I can see I see I doesn't agree with that either. They also told me we couldn't do targeted groups and one thing I did recently and I'm a total amateur so I'll say things in yuller more than welcome to correct me if it sounds wrong but. I went into it was specifically for YouTube because YouTube could just be all over the place but I was able to do geographic targeting and then I actually just asked chat GPT to create a list of. Biohacking influencers and search terms and the list based on my knowledge was really accurate and then I created a custom audience for people that have searched for those at any point so. If they've searched for some of these influencers they're going to know about what we don't do already so like I said that that hurdle of just people being aware of the things that we do and maybe how we're offering them. You already passed that if they're searching for Andrew Hubertman or Susan so bird. You don't need to know who those people are but I can give you the list so I created a custom audience and even with the geographic targeting it's still hundreds of thousands of people and now I can I'm currently serving. YouTube be adds to that group and again it's a small amount but it just feels. It feels a little bit more specific. So just wanted to share that. By the way my wife follows Andrew Hubertman a lot. One of his any of his hectic suit like becomes a piece beyond that matter. So yeah. Look information and everything. I just want to strike check to another topic just to know if they work the land or we land over there. Do you work with partners or channel partners or any coupon program for example maybe there's a saloon out there. Who has a banner or a leaflet that he if you buy our sin. We do set this together. We put for example for San Antonio. So is there anything to do partnership program or channel partnership program that he can. We can play. We should run your life. We've done a lot of partnerships that usually been very like in person where we've got we've got somebody on our team that physically goes to gems and places like that to get in front of their audience. I'm not sure if you're speaking about like digitally or in person. It person. It's actually a busy day works very well but since you are very vision. I said we it's going to be hard to find a digital partner. Most affected like a physical partner for example. You want to say go city market nearby. They're going to buy a coupon. Anybody who shops over 500 dollars. Yeah. Things like that. Right. We have thought about something like that. So we definitely thought about stuff like that right now. It's more referral agreements with nearby partners. We've got 20 plus partners that are very active and are sending us kind of a trickle for me to those places. Because it's slightly more involved to figure out how to get a. If you spend this much you get a coupon at wherever we've never really did. But. Dive in. That. That term is a. Tenses. And that kind of partnership yet but it's also because it's been so fruitful. On the lake from local business side. So far, even just going to their events and having them bring their audience to us has been really effective. And we're about to go to some apartment complexes and basically when somebody moves in they usually get a packet. So we're going to put it like a coupon in there like. You know free day pass. It's part of their move in because it's because then we can target that's a way to the way of partnering. So we're going to be a part of the way of partnering with Jay graphically. So yeah, those kind of ideas were we're definitely working on we call that gorilla marketing partnerships. The events we also do athletic events like if there's a race or a run or like this like yeah there was a 5k that we had two of our folks out on Saturday. They put on a table. They had you know, sauna hats and a couple things on there but the strategy it those just like it would be with apartments. This is the one time we do use free day passes. They've been incredibly effective in that in that specific use so they can refer people for free if it's their first visit. That usually works really well. Yeah, that team is actually outpaste our digital ads for about half action about a quarter of the cost. So if you guys can outpace them you. That that'll be the challenge. You're going to outpace our. Yeah, everyone. I'm very very very competitive. So in a fun way so if you can give us some like very specific ways we can measure that I think we'll it'll activate the good parts of our brain. Yeah, I think I think it may be as high as literally double so far. Yeah, the capacity for a quarter of the cost is the on on the ground real marketing stuff so we would love for that to change. Yeah, so yeah, that reminds me of a really important part of what we're trying to do is also like I know with both meta and Google where you've got Google meta tags or pixels where we want to track what a conversion is counted as. So for us an ideal conversion is a purchase of the day pass generally that half off offer. There are two strategies we have available. We can do a custom landing page where we've got one pull to action. It's a button that says purchase half off day pass which sends them to if you'll hear the term push press that's that's basically our CRM. So we'll talk about push press they have to make a purchase through push press and so on a point out push presses are pointed to sale. You know, as our CRM is not spec. Okay, yeah, I've heard push press call to CRM as well, but you want to know CRM they don't really manage leads and they don't really do outreach. So yeah, basically push press after somebody's been in the facility it's really good at managing members or people that have physically been to the space, but it did not do a good job of managing folks before they were in the facility as far as like a sales funnel type thing they didn't give us good tools. When we say, I'll expect that's generally referring to people before they've been into the facility and push presses after. So push presses where they have to physically make the purchase on the and we can do a. It's like a small landing page where they're just purchasing that one offer and we can make it say literally what they saw on the ad because we want to reflect what they're expecting. So the the big question we've had in the past is do we want them to go to a landing page where they have to click again to make the purchase. But they have the opportunity to learn more or do we want them to go straight to the purchase. We've seen a slight skewed toward better results when they go straight to the purchase page. There's just not a lot of data on there. So it may be a case where it depends on the ad set if we want them to engage more with content to learn more and then make the purchase or if we want to send them straight to the purchase page. We can also do a v testing there because so far it's been pretty clear but. So right. Yeah, I just popped into the chat. I won the radius from earlier, but to I just want to point out these are two pages side by side on. Like a little picture. Once the first visit day pass, it's had 973 views. The thank you page is people who've gone through the purchase and gotten to the confirmation page after purchase and that's like 65 right new unique views or 48 and the last 30 days. If we send them straight to push press where they where they purchase significantly more of those the ones that are getting to the thank you page confirmation at the end. If we send them to the first visit day pass or landing pages to purchase, you see the numbers that are really high there. They really don't they don't click three times. They'll click twice is definitely safe. But an a long time we need to capture those data. So what we can do is is, we can do that. We can just put benefits of the both world. We can have a bounce. We were in well while we will sit up. From the campaign user will click on a bounce or bounce and it will click two seconds. We redirect you to the post press. So that way we capture the data also we send you the to the post. You said the land page. The only tricky part is after the actual purchase. We were little bit limited on a. I'm creating you know a thank you page or a post purchase page. So what we've done is we've literally just put a button on there where it says. Click here to confirm and it's it's just making them manually send themselves to a thank you page. It's the best we can come up with because we can't. Basically and push press we we can't dictate that it goes to a different page. Am I explaining that right? Yeah, we we took of what I would call like a really dumb like low tech approach because their system just isn't that sophisticated. It wouldn't let us send to a like redirect but it would let us give a little message within a pop up set click here to confirm people do like 80% of the time click there to confirm. So yeah, let's give us pretty good data on that not great. So we can't get an email after the purchase like one thing that purchase it. Do you get an email like he's customer purchase. Yes, yes. We can work with the email once you got an email that's like the way that the. Oh, you need to send to thank you. That is so much better. I haven't thought about that. Yeah, that is that would be a direct like. Yeah, as long as yeah Google or met a wood and that could also help create a retireless. Okay, so we can also add them as admin specific person as admin Jeremy because it as admin you get those messages automatically. Like that's another another thing like that I mean you'll get all the messages all sales but you will get those messages every time. You can also direct purchase to go specifically to a specific person so email lives like. I would I would just try to push pixel somewhere like met a pixel or Google pixel where I can capture all the audience regardless of where they coming from. Yeah, so we may be bouncing what so bounce up page is basically a page where you don't see anything it just stays for one second and redirects you to the. Yeah, but the ones only capture all the news. Yeah, cool. We've tried either of those so thank you. Yeah. So that let me just give you the. The bad news is the all marketing and it's very badly that's the fact and I say knows this very well and I say literally. It tells me this every day like hey man marketing will die don't do. Of course. So there's a very good reason because every platform is coming up with AI I know you know, I go like today at tomorrow companies like our marketing services will be can make sting who knows because there are Yeah, we're in the platform making you guiding you to do what to do next right. That's another story. The reason I'm saying this marketing job needs to be evolved with the time. Whatever service or benefit we're going to bring you this month may not work next month. That's the sad part of it. But how much I how much this is my bringing to it just has to be evolved with the time that's what it is. And whatever strategy we do it has the time limit after certain time the strategy will not work. So capturing the data and storing it somewhere in a data being always good for us to ideate on bringing out new ideas. We can play so one platform's data can be used on other platform to target. For example, I get an email address. I'll go on YouTube and target them through the email address. You can come up with a lot of interesting ways to play with the data that he captured. Right. I love hearing that because that's what we've it seems like in the past we've had to change horses because they just they do one thing good in the next stick with it for a year and then just grind it down to where it doesn't work anymore. But they don't have to do. I told them I was like they were bringing us concerns but they weren't bringing a solution with it. So that's probably one of the things we'd ask is if you start seeing a problem with something's you know that's that's not working anymore. What's the next thing we're ready to pivot to and and I loved him or one of the big things that sold me as you said 20% of the budget should be testing the next thing. They were always responsive rather than being proactive. I love the proactive approach. I know that it costs money to do that but if we need that we've had kind of a roller coaster at times where you know we go from 80 feet in the door in a month to literally 20 a couple months later is what we saw. And you know it just it affects our you know obviously affects the business so we're just looking for more consistency and you know driving the cost that would be great but. But we're also trying to find what is the. What is the point of diminishing returns like I'm as long as we continue to see traffic in the door. I'm I'm totally eager to increase our ads been but we feel like sometimes we've overspent where we're not seeing as much traffic and we just need to be aware that because at the end of the day to still an expense. And if we're just pushing too hard to to overspend but we're really not seeing extra traffic from that. We kind of like to try and figure out where that point of diminishing returns are so we can. If you'll ask me for a budget I'll give you a budget but really we'd like to understand you know what is the point where the cost of getting someone in his twice. What it normally is or something like that. If he's a. If he's about traffic if you say like hey my name I mean traffic I can send you traffic traffic is there a problem but probably traffic has to convert. Yes, right. He's easy to get traffic by the way you can just. Yeah, I don't know where you will get a lot of traffic and we don't want to be a company or a team like that that's to. So, you can send you the wrong traffic. So the whole idea should be like if you get a traffic. If you have 2.5% conversion that is a very good conversion average conversion is 1.2 1.7. So out of like. 100 people want to people might to go out in the middle that's the real number. Let's say we can actually like 2.5% or 3% conversion we're literally doing the right thing. We would be that thing. So I'm I'm going to be very skeptic on deciding where to find the right type of traffic instead of just looking for the traffic. Sure. Let's take a look at your. Add the count. Okay, we're going to start with Google or meta. Let's start with Google. Okay. I'm going to screen share. I'm probably already logged in because I've been goofing around with it. So y'all are welcome to laugh or. To Joel as you please. I created a few of these because I don't know sometimes I just want to. Understand how these things work so we can have more educated conversations but. We're going to the last 30 days so basically. On the. The seventh of this month is when I kind of discovered there were some things not not happening in Google. So I went in and just started creating stuff. So all this craziness you see over here was Jeremy's ads. I mean it looks mostly very positive you know. I'll get rid of some of these. You know I was able to really. I don't know if conversions is accurate but you know I got a lot. I got a lot. You as the business owner immediately made a difference. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I mean we've seen we've seen actual purchases happen and that's what I told them. I was like I was a total amateur and. I was able to go in here and do some stuff and so one thing I've done. So this is really funny so if we go to red light in San Antonio. Hey no traffic people are just not searching for it. If I do the same thing in Dallas they're getting a ton of traffic on red light. It's really funny. Um. So Ana is obviously getting a lot more traffic. Um, but it's still that's that's not a lot of clicks for. Um, traffic. Uh, again these are very new ads so I don't know if there's a better way to do that but I'm basically just. You know they weren't doing anything specific so these are the search terms that are showing up. Um. But I'm not sure if there's a better way to do that. Um, I just started doing these. Uh, YouTube ads. Again, I don't think we obviously haven't had 50 purchases so there's something going wrong with conversions. Um, I'm giving these all. Uh, these are all text based UG ads. Um, I'm generally going to have um, there's a video going with it. Um, and it's it's really not that's the other thing is we need. We need some content that actually works on YouTube. I don't know much about it. I just did some of the videos that we had. And again it was just to kind of start testing. I didn't really expect much from it. They've had good success with. This is kind of specific to cold plunge, but what I did is I went in and fix the geographic area and fix some of the terms that they were using. Um, and just. What I also ran into was they were using really weird. Um, terminology and phrases in these ads. You know when you build them, you've got your headline and then you're all that stuff. And they did that. Like it was like, yeah, things click for one thing, which is why I created. You know, we're not going to get a lot of traffic from it, but I was like, if somebody searches for red light and then the ads is cold plunge, they're not going to click on it. Um, or our conversions going to be really poor. So the reason I created these categories is so that at least it may don't be a lot of traffic, but at least if they're searching for something, they're going to see in it ad and pictures that relate to it. So that's what I was trying to do again, we're we're getting really poor traffic, but we're getting better conversion rates. Um, and I was actually trying to reduce. They were getting most of our traffic from people searching for evil. You all human optimization lab. So people searching for our name and they were calling that a win. I don't know me personally. It's the only search for it. It had the right. It is literally the only one. It was the old. It was really the only search term they were and they were like really patent themselves on the market. They were getting conversions from people that were searching for our name. I'm like, that was we're already going to show up organically number one. So I just spent money to capture somebody that already knew about us. So I just personally don't think that serving an ad for our name makes any sense unless a competitor is doing it maybe, but I don't think that's happening. By the way, I do have a competitor. Ad set going. I don't think it's performing very well. So yeah, we're getting a little bit. I only kind of focus on the bigger names. I don't know. I got a personal vendetta against float essay. We're going to take those people down. I did want to turn off. I actually had to create a negative keyword for our other business. Because I think we that was actually showing up in here. But no, I can give you all a list of this businesses that do the same thing as us. And as I don't know, some people might think it's sketchy. I think it's just business, you know, like we're competing for. So I'm absolutely the biggest of the best to do it to. I mean, the way I look at this is like, okay, so these guys specifically we're going after them because they were members. And then they just happened to start have some of our services at their facility. So they're the ones I'm really going after. But hey, 26 of their customers know about us now. So these are all the terms that it's showing for. But I can get you actually the list and there's pretty good. So I don't need to send all this. But yeah, like these terms in the past, they were just the wording. Just you could tell that it was somebody outside the industry doing it. So if you all need me to create any of this stuff, I would rather provide it for y'all than trying to do that. I'm like, what does that mean, man? So yeah, it's just, again, just so many terms that weren't relevant to what people were searching for. Yeah, really confusing. So what would you like to see in here? Amran, is there anything you want me to click on her? I think it's good on the real business, but there should be a lot more water. We have to be a lot more work, putting to choosing the ads itself. Like the headline should be based on all services. So yeah, for example, if somebody search for some or the headline should be telling something about some. I'm not like a generic headline. So these type of continuity needs some work to be set up. So I see this is good as a generalist, but you have to put some time into it to sitting up and do some connectivity to the keyword. There is a secret, is it? Is it? Is it the headline doesn't say exactly what the keyword was? That would be a miscellaneous to people. Oh, by the way, this was an accident. I clicked on the wrong thing, but this is where they would make the purchase. So currently the ads that are showing persona, they would see that the words were discussing. And then if they click on the purchase, it would go here. So this is what they can see. Wow. Unfortunately, this is so that we know where it came from. But I don't think it's a negative thing, but they can see, you know, we can fill in this script. We can change this. So, but it's not in a very sexy. Is there any way for us to put, like below that, like at least like a map location or click for directions or something? So the person's like, well, I don't know how close this is can easily check. I don't think so. But we can certainly look. Yeah, this is basically like a landing page that push press creates and this field, the highlighted we can we can change. And then they have to click on more info, but we can put in text here. But that's a good point. So we've got like, when we're open. You know, but we can put more information in here. I'm not sure how helpful that'll be. Hi. I don't think the information here is a problem. The information is fine. People are just going to click by, but the main barrier would be not being able to track it. So if you could track it. So I see why you have done it. You're just, you know, like, this is the one way to see. Separate, take out page, you created to make sure. Transstand where things are came from. That's a nice hack. But ideally there should be a bit of a way to do it. Right. So to your point. Oops. That kicked me out here. Um, so this is for sauna. And so just kind of showing you all. So this is where that URL goes to that plan. Um, I actually, I don't know what to do here. So I'll show you all this stuff that I didn't touch. I put into these terms. You just want to point out Jeremy. We do actually have. Fifty sales right now showing for San Antonio. So that from the ninth. I know that you're saying 50 conversions. Like, I don't know if we actually do. Yep. Fifty sales right now. That's really good for the month. That's right. Good. Seven to most please. I'm sorry for me. All was the highest number. I think we saw from you all was in the 70s. So for already at 50, I am way out performing them, which is really sad because I'm no good at this. But yeah, these descriptions. Um, I try and make them. Interesting. Like, we are the unspawn services you want without the appointments. And shut up. I'm just trying different things. Some of them are, but they're all at least. I think relevant. And then. Um, images. I can get you all more. But since this at a specific to sauna, these are all kind of sauna. And red light images. Um, so I just kind of have those in there. Um. When it this stuff, I get really confused by. I don't know. I don't have any of this stuff really filled out other than, you know, the full number. Um, so there's there's probably a lot more detail that can go in. We've got a few sight links. I don't even really know where those show up. So again, just, uh, I'm confused why this is showing up here though. I don't know if that's just because we have both accounts. The location was given in. I have one question. I wrote the first example. Imagine you clicked on the checkout button. You landed on the push, push press website like this page. Um, didn't follow too. Okay. Do you see how many people didn't follow through? I don't think when they go to this one. If it was a landing page, we could, but with this, I don't believe we have that data. Unfortunately. Yeah. And the magic of it, the real magic, the word Amazon and the big companies kind of shine is to track you down. And NAU wants you to check out and be in the pharmaceutical phase. So there's where all the equals company like if you go into a shoe, check out phase and don't buy the shoe. Like I, they're going to bother you for 30 days. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's something up like this. Remember the bouncing page, the bounce page I mentioned. If you have a bounce and don't include the push press URL, you're going to push a special URL. And whenever somebody kicks and check out, they will land on this special page. And then we'll do it to push this. Now, this way, we'll, we'll have a pixel. Maybe you can find a way if the person actually checked out on our part. And that is still, there's still a missing part. Yeah. I'm going to connect the user. Can we, by the way, can we, I'm just asking, I don't know how much you know about push press. Is there any way we can send a random number or a reference number on a push press that can be found in the checkout. Like if you go to the push press website again. Go on this, go on the push press. Oh, yeah, sorry. Yeah. So, you might, you might, is there a random number I can pass for them? Look at the URL page. Line, landing slash, plan slash, plan and risk code. Oh, right here. If I have a random number, then I can give a random number to every busy. That way, I can track if that person actually checked out on one. That's anything that would help me to tie the traffic to the conversion. That we can see as much as I would like to. This is the thing we've been hitting our head against since we owe. Yeah, like no, I don't think we can. It's something push press allows us very, very little that we can change. Unfortunately, the thing, I'll be very advanced. But I'll show you all the alternatives. So this is Dallas is so if we wanted to. Again, I don't know how much the difference was between going directly to the purchase page versus the landing page. But there is large. Yeah. Was it that page? It was the difference between us getting. Very few sales and a lot of sales. The biggest change you made between what they did before and what you did now, Honestly, is you sending it straight to the conversion page. Everything was going to landing pages last month, that's when we got 17 sales. I don't even know that the app. That's a change that much, right? It. It. One month's another. I would like you guys to test it anyways because again, Y'all on the data side was very, very poor. So there could be something we, you know, There was happening on the back end that was affecting that. But, you know, if they click here, they end up back at the purchase page. The most common issue with people bailing out from a landing page, It'd be like if somebody clicked on the ad, then landed on a page, which does not represent the same branding. They would feel like they might be. The only reason the most probable reason people bailing out is with you. People with the same branding are these stealing make-they can or am I checking out? Right. We could also, as far as I understand, it's easy for high-room to create more landing pages. So we could also create landing pages that reflect the ads more closely. This is basically kind of educating them on what it is. But again, this picture ideally, if it's a sauna ad, this picture would show somebody in a sauna. That's the kind of stuff that may have been affecting our purchase rates to your point. And we're on if they weren't seeing an ad that directly affects, Or I'm sorry, landing page that directly reflects the ad. Maybe that's part of where we're getting a disconnect. And I think to one of the things, I know this is an exactly what this meaning is about. One of the things you'll talk about is how much better it would be if you all may throw landing pages, So that you could reflect those kind of changes and stuff like that. And I do see how that could be super useful. Because I can duplicate a landing page. I can change out a picture. There's still not a lot of data behind it. So there is some limitation there. But if we, to save the time for y'all on the landing pages, if you, and again, something I haven't mentioned is we do, you know, 20 different things that evolve. I always talk about like there's there's basically like five that people might actually be searching for or that have like a broader awareness. Sonna is is very high on the list. Red light therapy actually did a, I went in and Google will tell you how many people are searching for certain terms. Red light actually surpassed Sonna recently. So it's a big topic of conversation. And we're on to your point. Um, Cubaman has done an entire episode on red light therapy or light therapy. So red light. Sonna's and we do both types of Sonna's traditional and infrared. That can be kind of confusing for people outside the industry, but they're, they're two different services and they, they work differently. And it's actually a strategic advantage. I don't know of any other facilities, especially franchises that have a traditional and infrared son on both. We never try running ads to that effect, but so red light Sonna's cold plunge. And then compressions leaves a little bit. I don't know that people are really seeking out a place to go and do compression sleeves. They greatly enjoy it. But I don't know if it's really a big search term. I feel like I'm forgetting something. The massage chairs are very popular, but I don't think people again, if they're searching for massage chairs, they probably want to buy one. I don't know that they're looking for a place to go and do a massage chair. So out of all the different categories we could run ads for, it's really just those, those three. That I think we will get searches for, which is why I have, you know, three ad groups that are basically red light, Sonna cold plunge. This gets into our competitor and I'm not sure what this branding one is. I think this is. Oh, yeah, this is this is kind of like a little bit of everything. And then YouTube is where I created. I don't know if it would be interested in this. But the group I created. I will always show us time on it. Oh, audiences, that's really nice. And then I don't want to this shows. Lifestyle, the move. Oh, yeah, biohacker. So this is the custom list that I created. 10 to 50 million. I think that's for the United States, but then we geographically target it as well. Anyway, what else, what other questions do you all have, or do we want to switch to meta? Yeah, I think let's switch to meta. And I guess I don't remember where you're going to access. So if you want to while you're in their grant us accesses. That's good idea. Yeah, I'm going to be the other thing. I really hate that you have to go through your own profile for this. I think it's so silly. It's ridiculous. And I haven't played with these, but it does seem like they've gotten a lot more sophisticated in meta. You know, you've got a lot of different ad groups. So if this has tests or Ricky, those are employees. We're actually testing out running meta ads through their account, so that it doesn't look as much like a net and it's kind of like a personal touch. So far, they were trending pretty well. But this just launched very recently. So. Okay, so let's see, I've done this. Man, they make it challenging on getting your access. Hmm, so these are the folks who've got in here. Y'all actually need to kick out pretty soon. Let's see if it partners. This is where you'll need to be added in. So. These guys show up because. So if you all have an ad account with an ID number, that makes it a lot easier. Because I can assign an asset to that ID. Otherwise, we can use email and kind of like like, manny with alt. We're using his email address, but it doesn't seem to work as well when you'll accept when you're on that. We have an ad account right. I met a business account. Yeah, we have a business. I'm sure. We have not by the way, we have not posted any ad for our work yet. Oh, assign assets. That's where it is. So I can just select both. Where do we have to plan to plan for the first time? Where do we have to plan to plan for the first time? I'm going to do that. There we are. I've given my email address there. If you can invite me on this, I will invite everybody else on the. Yeah, on zoom. We try that. We're going to say, what do you want to assign to? Let's try. I think I'd like your days. I'm going to say that. Let's try. Let's try this. I'll see what happens. I'll see if I can find the link. But Travis had a company who's working with where they walk the user through this ad on process and it worked really good. I've been working with the company. It tells you where to click and give you the information from the ad agency for it. I would have to invite my team with this. I says, I may need to ask you to give me more access. It needed later. There's one. It was giving me the. I think it's going to be a good idea. I think it's going to be a good idea. I think it's going to be a good idea. I was able to, I was able to do that for these guys. I should just go ahead and kick them out. Right. I think so. Yeah, there's literally no reason to keep it. And they're not working on. I'll just gruntled they are. Man he's OK. He's with all. Let's try this. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to try that. Nope. And then sometimes meta just doesn't work. Sorry, you're a civilian messaging me. Go into the chat. Oh, no. It's just stuff. I'm going to use. Oh. There we go. Let's try that. There we go. Maybe that's it. Oops. That was Dallas. Oops. Well, hopefully, I'm sure Dallas will be on board soon. So you already have access. This is where I would like to get you guys, but that's where I need that ID. So I think that is better access, but it doesn't let you type in. You have to have the ID for this section, which is why y'all's in there. It's actually this remove access. I don't want them to see what y'all are doing. That's your info. Ajay, may I paste it an ID? Zoom. Can you try this? Ah, yes. Thank you. Got it. Coffee. Let's try that. Purple. See, is this our assistant's ID? Eight for? Yes, why did this is the business ID? I mean, you can paste it. Paste it to the assigned partner. Go to the assigned partner. Yes. Now we have to paste it. Yeah. I'll do that first. Let me see. There we go. I've been in it. Hey. I'm right. Make sure that looks like you have full access. That should do it. Yep. It looks like it. This is my cool. Have fun. That's a mess in there. I don't understand that at all. For some reason Google seems a lot simpler to me. This is like a complex. It's not just you. The whole one. It's maybe. The whole one. It's meta. Yeah, that's a. That's pretty true in general. Okay. Just for everything. Maybe we can only. We got hacked in 2023 or no 2021. And it took us three months to get back in there. It was a nightmare. You can't get a hold of a person. Okay. So for this, I want to get you guys in. Okay. I'm sure it's admin. Access and security. Okay. I see your pages. Thank you. Mm-hm. Let me come from again. I see. I see you. I see you. Sorry. I don't see your pages yet. Uh, I see. Do you see? I think I think we don't get the. The page access. Okay. Yeah. Jamie, would you mind going to the assets and allow us access? Can't think. Mm-hm. Do you have a question? You can go back on. You can go back on. You can go back on. Now you can go back to the assets. Individus. Ah. Okay. Jamie, you can go to the pages and then. Ah. Yeah. Gotcha. Thanks, Cecil. Oh, sorry. I'll miss. Uh, you just add business. I need to add business. I just added business. I need to add business. Yes. You just set a tab partner. Ah. There we go. Uh, but what is the partner here? No, it's a different. Maybe it's just the best. Sorry. I'm sure moving these guys will be here. I think that's the same way. Yeah. Just see. I think that's a partner. I think that's not a bad tidy. Excuse me. Oh, sorry. I didn't see that. Okay. Gotcha. Nice. You're going to add a counter there. I can't do that. I think that one. Nope. You're going to do it. Okay. Take on the partner steps. We are already. Yeah. I don't see it. I see. Oh, it says. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't see it. I don't see it. Oh, it says. Yeah. Yeah. I don't see it. I don't see it. I don't see it. Oh, it says. Yeah. Just click on the partner step. Oh, sorry. Yeah. No. Oh, I got it. Congratulations. Thanks. I agree. Jeremy, you also have pixel, right? So my need to the pixel. So Jeremy, there's a Facebook has a lot of products. 38 products. So as a partner, you have to allow us access to each of them. Whatever you want to work as a, you know, you want us to work. So this is an interior. Yeah. There's. Okay. Hmm. In the data set. Oh, we just, it is in the data set. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Here's the pixel. I'm just going to. I'm just reading these as we go. So did you try to install pixel in the push press, too? Push press. I think it's a sign in the landing page, but I don't think push press will allow us to change any code. There you are. Oh, um, I don't know what this is. Uh, they're representing data to your Facebook. I mean, push press probably has a Facebook integration that pushing. See, I'm going to hear. We have to see the data set there pushing. Yeah. Put you all in there. We'll see what happens. I'm not sure. You can also like, I drew the press press. Yeah. Okay. This could mean we can target push press people. They must have some sort of connectivity with Facebook or whatever. We'll see. They're sending data. Yeah. This is me. Okay. That's all good. Um, anywhere else that they sneak to the. Uh, the Instagram account. Can you check there? Uh, yeah. Oh, there we go. Great. Yeah. Oh, there we go. Great. Yeah. The web of madam. So you don't use WhatsApp by NHS, right? No, WhatsApp. No, not yet. And I haven't. No. If people do ads, you just have, just run out of curiosity. Is WhatsApp a good business model because here in Asia, WhatsApp is literally OK. Nothing sales more. So on your side, are you guys not, do you guys use WhatsApp that much or does business that do the stay away from WhatsApp? It. And stay away from it. Like I'm on it. That's like our like more like a text chain for like the thousands of students to. So, too. I don't think anybody like is super trusting WhatsApp on the business side here. I've only used it for like international calling or texting. But not not local. Pretty common in the USA guys is. Most people I know don't have WhatsApp unless they go on an international show. Yeah. That's that's very interesting because that is what there is a US product, but most of his customers are our ideas. Yes. Yeah. That's cool. We just need to be fixed. Um, think this is OK. We can get the other one. I see. Do you have access to ads and pixels everything? I get you. Learn. Learn. Thank you. Jenny, I'm putting my email address here for Google apps. This is my email address for Google apps. If you want to invite me. OK, let me see. Got it. It's not. Oops. Is that right? Yeah. I'm giving you another minute. Just a two. Oh, I get to fix that. Let me see. That was. I saw this the other day. We've only got certain domains that are. I think that might be an our general account. So, so what I can see in our business portfolio. So I can see we're reading the events from Ebola view, my left's big zeldeta set, but not from push press. No problem. Push press is a different problem. We'll figure it out later. OK. Thank you. There's somewhere in here where maybe it's here. We've got a list of domains that are accepted. Jamie, do you mind if I guide you? Sure. No, I'd love that. Thank you. OK, let's go to the previous page, access and security. So click on the security tab. Ah, thank you. That's it. Just allow the can't sync domain and VNPZ domain. Let me type domain here. Would that be right? Yeah. Perfect. Let me give you another domain. Green-out studio. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. It's not. it's not just a Zoom chat-tefl Rh majority area coffee. Thank you. Ok. of the women or more friendly also a see who is that man. Yeah. All of them have been. Oh. Hmm. Yeah. I'm sure there's an admin. Interesting. Yeah. And you're not invited by anybody either right here. Yeah. Oh yeah. That's probably a workspace setting. Yes. I have bad things. I have a meeting on this during the interview. Yes. It's probably not here, Jeremy. This is your personal settings. Hmm. Okay. You want to, if you send me an email on it, we can jump off. So. Yeah. Yeah. It's probably not here, Jeremy. This is your personal settings. Hmm. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So here's what we're going to do. Thank you. It was a great start. Chase. And I'm on in our sear. Let's collect what we saw today and some of those ideas. And I've just the growth of the bets forward. A little bit for tomorrow to make sure we're really nailing the ads first. And then we get another.

 play. I sure do. My play quite a bit actually. I was in some bands here in Austin that got wrecked from COVID, but now I still play with my daughter and we'll do gigs here in there being whatever in orchestra rock band you know. That's awesome man. That's awesome. Yeah, I played for I don't know, 30, 40 years early on you should manage bands and started being in bands and got tired of being tired. But one of my kind of retirement goals when we traveled my wife and I both travel for fun and I like to get to know people in places not just kind of be voristic when I tour. So I thought you know it was in center of paint last year and I thought you know when we were tired I wanted to just do acoustic sets you know you know like we say in center pay for a few weeks play a couple gigs man get to know locals get to know the travels just for a bottle of wine that's all we need you know me just as kind of a fun thing to do so I've been helping my game kind of get back into performance mode and also taking that vocal lessons every week I can I can carry a tune but I figured you know I got four more years before kind of ready to get to that phase four years of lessons in practice I want to be just surprisingly good I want people to go that's better than I thought it was going to be so that's my goal hurt I love this okay this is great because you know Jeremy and higher and play oh yeah as well we need to get ourselves a set list for the next together that's Jeremy you have Jeremy I have a drum set right over here yeah so Jeremy's yeah when we first started getting things set up up here he would come and and he is a good solid drummer man he's he's fun to play with I my understanding is he was going to be a pro for a while yeah he certainly has a chops and we we're pulling at like Arctic monkeys and some other songs that just have some very intense you know not your basic drum kit you type of performance he's he's he's a star for sure right on okay well I can't wait to play with those guys and yeah your retirement idea sounds incredible I took my I took a plastic trumpet to Bangladesh two times now people thought it was the craziest thing but it's not as it's not as inviting as a guitar and singing so love that plan yeah now you gotta change it up man it's always fun so how's your plan going how things going with you guys anyway just on the side note oh they're they're okay the main thing that is causing me outrageous amounts of heartburn is the build process our architect is just wildly behind schedule oh behind schedule and I am a complete rookie at brick and mortar yeah all my businesses are digital and you know corporate so we're actually looking this month at because the SBA loan the they they unlock the small amount of the deposit but we actually can't unlock the vast majority of funds until permits on file with the city right permits can't be on file until and so there's all these and we're just waiting on this one things to salmon are going crazy right now because everything else is like doing well we've got all these takeover scheduled we've got a lot of interest and it's just not moving and our bank account is suddenly empty so I could find something else for salmon to do for a month or so while we just wait so other than that is great but that really sucks yeah no that that's a tough one man you know I another retail company I had for a long time is American pario bit I had I created that and then I franchiseed before I sold it so I've gotten to do some brick and mortar so I've had you know over a decade of experience in brick and mortar is and most of those gigs I did my you know I'd GC it myself is all fucking duct tape and stuff because we do have the funds to do it right this time you know I got extremely well known GC and Dallas I mean this guy is so much pool we had we got our we got our green tag our CO without power because the inspectors knew the GC and was like oh you know if he did it it's good I mean I'd never run into anything like it so just going forward man I probably paid 15% more maybe 20% more for the whole project but he his architect just rock solid he's rock solid and I'll tell you the other thing that I've been really surprised at over the last year a couple things have come up and whatnot I call him he gets you know there's AC issue the owner of the AC sub you know the subcon contractor the owner comes out that day that afternoon to deal with my issue another thing I'd get something kind of rewired no charges his people were on it so as you get to multiple occasions if this one goes well if I could go back in time and say hey Kurt go ahead and don't look for the cheapest get someone who has some juice with the city it was game changer for me no kidding so highly recommend and he does work in a he does work in Austin so next time we should have talked three months ago yeah that's a bomb yeah so anyway I'm excited for you guys to grow up you know the the water rises all boats and I'm hoping that that's going to be in full effect as you know as you guys start to hit market and that kind of stuff as well I think so too yeah exactly I just the demand for this kind of thing is increasing so much we want people to really adopt what's innovative about the model and you know the playground aspect of it and lack of appointments I think it's huge and in here in George Townsend I'm in North Austin there are at least three different places now that are like under construction or something but in the suffer from those same problems it's like we do just cryo and redlight therapy and their appointments and I'm talking to people I was like yeah it's $200 every time I walk in there like oh yeah so yeah the the model is brilliant another side story the first a year ago year little over a year ago I'm coming back after you know a long day of takeovers on a Saturday and you know I'm still you know we just we put a half million in right so we're still in that a little bit anxiety and I sit down and watch in a Sarah at live just to relax before I go to bed and Josh Brolin comes out does his monologue at the end of his monologue he cold punches like they drag and cold punch out and I'm like I thought I thought it was hallucinating at the time and I'm like okay so the time is good but but you're right the model you know we have the two two players coming into our spades and to Dallas right now Dallas sawna house and one other guy and you know they they got the big three the cold plunge the sauna and the red light but again the same old tired model that you know and I look at it this way it's it's really they aren't even competition because if people want a spa experience where I'm setting up their towels and giving them cucumber water then go to these other places because that's not us if you know and and we can't compete with that on the other hand if they want to open model and come whenever they want and pay a lot less then that's our model and they can't compete with us so look it's market awareness I'm you know I'm I'm preaching to an expert but I think you know the model I think will hold out really really well now I do worry when big money comes in and comes in with the model like ours but hopefully we're gonna get our elbows out enough to where you know they're gonna do it in some of the part of the country because they're gonna do it here because we own Dallas for Austin or Texas. Let's go cool good well let let me let let me let me show you a couple things that I think you'll find interesting and then see where that leads us okay so go over here the reason that we are talking is because we just started taking on growth marketing for evolve San Antonio and I just been doing it for ourselves you know the whole time but I wanted you to just kind of get a sense of how we work I run an anti bureaucracy shop I've done a lot of turn around and different things and so what we do is once a week we sit down and plan one of these columns which we call a growth sprint and our team executes that growth sprint and we kind of t-shirt sizes a small medium large extra large with these things story points so one point is small two points is actually one point is extra small two points is small you know three point is big like this and so what we do is things like all right let's create a sauna landing page and video sales letter this week get it done and ship it and make it have results next week we want to ab test um this one landing page that we just created versus push press the ticket system and see which one converts better because we have a hypothesis that the landing page is going to convert better right week after that we do xyz and so this growth bet model is something that I sort of built by leading product teams and turning it into the growth world and Jeremy's found that to be attracted because a lot of brand marketers tend to focus a little too much on pictures and how beautiful something is as if that's the finish line as opposed to the result and right um that's really the main thing so as we look at a couple of other things because you mentioned travel I wanted to show you this this is one of our other um ones we just made where uh inron he's on the phone here he's one of my business partners he and I designed and built this travel app for a client and we've just started deploying this as their marketing and built uh there's a nice video here and built their web pages and stuff but uh we know that this is just like having a business card it doesn't actually need the business right and so uh what else do you do we build these funnels for the full ecosystem of how are you getting awareness in the first place acquiring those customers activating them and then uh you know retention marketing right and each of these funnels is 100% custom to the situation so our evolve uh Dallas I mean not Dallas or evolve Austin journeys right now we're all top of funnel focused because it's a brand new outlet where as a person no one you is actually some top of funnel but more acquisition focused um and so that's really it um I don't know if you've seen any of the work yeah I would be the visual stuff you know good videos that kind of things so Jeremy thought interested in taking a peek and that's all I know that's the one we're here right on now it looks good and um I mean look as to me the the metrics is how many new people are coming in um you know the conversion the the ability to convert you know often happens in the in the lab and that's obviously comes to a lot of the sales training and our own staff again you know there you certainly can convert online I mean that's great too and I know with right now with Jeremy we're really focused on retention because again you I mean I have to explain to you the cost of you know getting a new one versus keeping one you want to just keep the ones you have push best did did just come out with some uh and I'm not sure if you got to see it yet but the commitment club is kind of where you can get streaks and that type of stuff that that has been lacking and they just launched that last week so I'm I'm kicking the tires on that to see how that's going to work that should certainly help reduce the churn because that has been one of the surprises is the churn when you dive into the numbers it's lack of utilization lack of priorities and that type of stuff and that comes into an education piece for us but I have noticed with y'all who have fairly good success early on you know when I start to look at the new visitor rates they're they're diminishing quickly so you know I know mainly I don't really do social medium trying to get back on it I've a love hate thing with it but my wife is on it fairly consistently she's seen the same ads over and over again and that you know repetition works to a point and then it becomes really inefficient so I'm hoping going with you guys we get back to that you know the goal and look I you know we need to see at least a hundred visitors new visitors per month for location to get it and then you know my job on that is to get at least a 25% or higher conversion rate for that I'd like to be closer to one fifty to two hundred honestly new visitors in a month and that way I can you know we that 25 or thirty 35% conversion rate will keep us at a healthy growth so that's that's kind of what I'm looking for obviously there's a little bit bigger spend with you guys and I know you guys do the content creation so I guess one I wanted to get your to take on on my expected returns that I just kind of gave you and two is we do have a really good one of our lab tech is great at social media and and she's you know we're paying like ten bucks a post so she's very cost effective as well and even get a Jeremy's like man a lot of time your social media posting is better than ours so question one my metrics and expectations too since we do have a built in solid content you can tell me after looking at our content that she does a good job is that something we could still utilize with you guys or or you know is it a replaceable thing is more better what's your thoughts on that thank you so we would not want to replace something that's working our job is to come and take bad to good or non-existent to exist and so we have a full range of services that we do I think we have a menu that may have sent it to you actually hold on I'll grab it here you go so the way that we look at this stuff is just there are activities that drive the results and we have to keep our eye on the ball on all of them this is a non-exhaustive list of the types of things that we'll do so we might we meet with you once a week to decide so if you did have a week where you're like oh no she I don't know got sick for two weeks and we're behind on two weeks we'd just be like okay great let's slot some story points towards social media post creation but outside of that we're gonna probably mostly focus on other types of things like especially if you're wanting you know top of funnel focus then we're gonna probably especially focus hard on ads and then on content marketing right like what kind of very serious top of funnel educational piece have you got that's got people downloading and giving you their contact info so that you can nurture them towards close so I think I would like to have Imron share his screen for a second if you don't mind showing some of what we found in the way that San Antonio is doing ad spend what we're worried about in a way that's probably good for us but bad for you is that if y'all also ran some of your ads it's pretty pretty messed up and there's a way to be a lot more efficient with that so I'll let you go for a second yeah you've all y'all's had our ads for like the last year so I didn't touch that at all so yeah now I'm very curious your analysis okay and once he's done I'll tell you one more thing go basically what we saw is that the most of the ads are kind of like I'm just gonna be like proud flood using this small word empty US in a way in a way because if you just look at this number I don't know if you can see my screen yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so these are real numbers we took from from their ads account and uh it you can't see the like these they have the spend a lot of money and the cost is quite high and generally if you're very these are like a really high conversion rate as you can see it's like sure because we saw those more ads were not properly set up but uh on a general level whenever you put money into ads it needs to be properly set up and properly delivered just to make sure the return of the investment or or the value you're trying to get properly I think and we do see like they're trying to they have made improvement over the over the following months like may or June you see this is just spending less also the the conversion rate very very high because they probably have improved few of the this is just a nature of how they're spending and I'm just gonna say like their Facebook ads are especially a little bit out of control and they are yeah they're not referring to this spend like $2,000 a month as you can see this is like quite high cpm rate and kicker this that's also cost per purchase is very high because those ads were not properly reached to the right customer you're not a way of example I'm an often and I got your Dallas Evolvads I was like what is this doing here yeah that's terrible the way we would the prioritizes make it very hyper localization is kind of like really hyper so yeah a lot of the final budget that you're planning for ads also the personalization kind of gives you more focused and more the more localized view from each ad and whatever the campaign method is can be awareness it can be about sales or can be about just booking you get accurate result from each ads at spending the way we're trying to solve or improve as it is to improve up on their the extinct strategy and we have already made some ads plan that's gonna go out this week and our goal is to first create a setup with our owners then try to close and create an audience level on hyper localized strategy that's how we we are probably I'm highly hopeful I'm gonna be too optimistic at analysts we see results after running few months but it's getting much better than what they're previously I've been seeing excellent what kind of radius in Austin are you working it to do I mean Dallas has even a little bit more dense but what what what mile radius or you you consider optimal in Austin because we're in suburbs we're in the 15 mile radius whereas if I was a little closer to downtown I would be in more the 10 mile radius yeah even in Dallas particularly in our neighborhood setting I'm not sure for how from a year or a with Dallas yeah five to 97 might be might be might be where it's at if you can kind of if you can get it whittle it down that much because over 10 miles is you know is another is another city in some ways in our little area so again and we can also play with that as we go forward will you do kind of the analysis of what they've done here or do you just move forward normally we do this do the analysis and or it first just get our knowledge ahead but actually not what you're completely on anything or finding just for our own understanding of how things been so we can make the change accordingly one of the like about location is that radius is one thing but when you throw an air it's not just about radius you get to play with other attributes and factors like the business location the the world you're gonna office and race or the names or you know the ethnicity or the people or their behavior let's say we're not target people who has a path day to day things like that see right on you get to clean with a lot of stuff if you do have time to explore is not just always about location the in California is was we're targeting some of the businesses and organizations that are around us so in in roundrock specifically Dell headquarters is right there about a mile so it'll be right so we're working hard on how do we target those employees and I wonder I don't actually know my Dallas geography that well but I know you know some mega corporations are for sure headquarters there I'm wondering what are in close distance for you yeah and I can do we don't all the hubs like Toyota and that type of stuff are all kind of in the sub of area we're kind of in the thick of it but like SMU is right across the street and you know we've a hard time kind of penetrating we'll get in with the sorority and then we can tell it will spread out we'll get a good chunk of them the the problem with that the the challenges then they leave for the summer and then we have to do it again the next year so there'll be some targets on that type of thing which I'm happy to start funneling as we meet on a weekly basis I can all you know keep kind of guiding you and give me a little bit more insight to what I think might be helpful here well cool well I mean again I

 And currently between San Antonio and Dallas, we actually pay into it too, because we feel like that's more fair. We should feel that. And we sequester that money to make sure that it's only used to benefit franchisees. So currently it's San Antonio and Dallas, obviously round rock hasn't paid into it yet. But there's some funds in there and we actually would like to spend it, but we want to be very careful that it's something that benefits both San Antonio and Dallas at this time. And then once round rock has part of that. So if there's a project that we could push forward, that would benefit both locations, either in creating, you know, we could fast-paced creating landing pages that could be used for either or it gets tricky with ad budget, like we don't spend it typically directly on ad budget, because that's kind of like separate. But if there's a project that can benefit everybody as a whole, we can put some funds toward that and fast-paced, which is one of the things I love about how you guys operate the point system. So basically I'm saying, like, if there's anything that's, if you guys have the bandwidth or something that we can fast-paced, that will allow us to make San Antonio and Dallas's adds more effective or tools that you guys would need, we can put extra funds toward that separate from the money that each location is paying for. That's a very useful time now. Because there's an only RR here, that comes online. And I don't know how to work, because it wasn't a collaboration, especially because you guys all operate on the same domain. So it's hard to turn one person for something that just helps everyone with the domain. So that's actually very useful to know. So we'll come up with a couple of ideas for that specifically. And that could also, I mean, we've been relatively happy with Squarespace. I get different opinions on how, you know, some people will say that it's terrible and it messes up your SEO. Some people think it's fine and it's more important what you do the content. But if you guys were brutally honest, like, would a, how much would a, we would be open to a quote for a custom site, for things like good trips or traveling OK, or just going to cover them, allowing you guys that way out. And then the concept of a custom site, which is cool, just like this, will bring you the new dot set of fonts. I think I think I was right at that. Yeah, so we've been to a quote for that and just I don't know if you'll have any thoughts already on how limiting square spaces and if a custom site would be beneficial or if that's. Yeah, I think yeah, well definitely show you what we think that my initial kind of gut feeling is square square square space is fine for definitely setting up a business. But the idea that your guys is going is to franchise and kind of branch out. Like I got some point you definitely are going to want to change. Like it's just at some point, maybe now it's not the time. That's definitely your call. But at some point you're going to want to switch to something else because it can only support so much and it will start limiting you. I think at some point. I guess have you ran into any problems yet or is it kind of just more theoretical problem? Because not really. We kind of like being able to go and play with it. I can share some of it. So any types of no code platform like weeks or square space of any other no code platform is a lot of boiler plates in a stable. That's what probably generally saying like it is bad for you see. Because it just like here's a huge number of contents automatically there. I'm not very searching it fairly. When you create a site on your own, every line is very good. So it is something that people talk about but I'm going to go with. It depends on two things. Number one is a mileage of work anyway. Either this way or that way. We can make things work in a square space. It's just going to take more time like the way we do go high level. So looks is very important. People cares about the look and the context. Second thing about the management. What precedes like the king of the website? Like 70% website is on a board press. No doubt in that. Also, it requires you to manage it. So first question would be if you are comfortable managing your what press set as you are squashed this. Then we know the first check mark is done. Second would be designing the website. What type of website you design for you? I'm confident I can make the same thing for you in a square space or go high level. Though they will take more time because my developers are more into WordPress because that's the common technology we all use. It's going to take some time but we can make that happen. On what was quite specific to it just depends on your comfort. I'll try it as that. It's like this is like Apple. It's like Apple. It's like Apple. It's that fast. Because you know I can come up with a lot of reasons. Hey Jay, you don't do these do this but it's just going to be my point of view. We have done so many things and worked with so many clients. At the end of the day, what matters is looks and proper wording. Proper messaging no matter why do you put it. Yeah, that's kind of where my thought is but I grew chase also like. It seems like something we have to do at some point and. It'll just get harder as we have more locations so. It's something we would consider it definitely depends on how much the cost is because we. We don't have unlimited funds in brand fun but that seems like something that the if the brands if each location would benefit from that's a possibility. I put an evil idea. I'm talking your idea so the evil idea is that you do have to manage you have to make sites for other branches. The more branches you open you have to liability or responsibility to maintain the quality of the sites. If we do get into that route. Chase we can just create a. Multis are what does there's a amu what press is special type of what press where you can install multiple websites. The benefit would be there's like one head office will just create a one nice team and that team gets used by everybody. So whenever a new owner comes in he doesn't have to do much he just gets a rise. I'm pretty in a day so and it just gives you more benefit to manage five sites for a single page. And a serious taken care of looks is taken you don't have to worry about the branding color and. So that that that there would be like if we do get into a custom when you do get into a custom. Whatever we do should be something that subs every franchise every brand. Yeah. Also gives them their own privacy. Hmm. I think I can not want to be. Also, you guys can use as like a benefit of joining your franchise versus any other franchises like. The website comes done we've already spent. Money figure and out how did the SEO work, you know, we've already figured that out for you. So you know, don't really worry about it. Yeah, it's a I would say my primary concern with the website is when if so princess when we run float we've got a website that's just that location and people know that it's local and it feels local. I'd say a disadvantage to a franchise is that they're going to realize that it's one branch of multiple when you go to that site. I don't know how that affects SEO but if we could create an appearance of each location. Almost has their own site and it feels, you know, it only if it could be replicable in a way that's not crazy cost effective to stand up each page. But if we if we did it in a way where it's instead of just a page, it feels more like each location has their own site that would be really interesting because it would I feel like it would elevate that experience for franchisees and guess would feel like it was more. And local and less cookie cutter. Yeah, have you thought about like detecting uses location somewhere that we if they use a lens on round road, you can just say you were you looks like you were in San Antonio, you should be so we try. So if we don't go do going to a custom site as Chase mentioned, we can come up with some awesome ideas that would like really separate you from other people. Yeah, I mean, I can start the conversation at least and yeah, if you all wanted to see what that would. What that would cost and look like and and that's the thing is right now it's just three. Soon to be four locations that's that's easy and if you know each time somebody on boards there's a little bit of you know franchise fee and things like that so if we know what it costs to add a location and that's reasonable. And then we can pay you guys a monthly amount to maintain it that goes out of the brand fund that that supports the website. You know that would be kind of like separate from the tech fear what not. We would be yeah, we would be open to a conversation about that. Great. Cool. I'll definitely talk to those about that get us dogs and what you know. It's really what makes everybody win. That's all we care about at the end of the day. Yeah, I'm cool. Any other questions on as far as the spreadsheet was there anything that you saw? No, just outside of the website any other ideas that would help fast pace the success of Dallas and San Antonio. Just let us know and we can. You know, just agree to it and then we can pay an invoice to kind of get this going because both as you heard from Kurt because of the poor performance of the Google ads, you know they're not seeing as much traffic. As we had in the past and in San Antonio. I don't know how much that is a little bit seasonal like right right as kids are getting out of school and people are going on vacations. There's a little bit of a low but summers are usually pretty good. So we you know after I fixed our Google ads we started seeing a lot more traffic. It you know the flow opened up a week later. So anything that you guys see that could. That's kind of blocking you guys from doing. Good work that will affect both San Antonio and Dallas. We can we can talk about that. Yeah. Has anyone told you about flare AI at all? Have we talked about that? I've heard the term before. I can't remember the context but yeah I would love a refresher course. So flare AI is the brainchild of a good friend of Isaiah's that he's basically built this. Agentic system that uses like AI it uses like five AI agents and I'll call it like that the technical stuff out. Basically it's doing quite wonders for websites as far as SEO goes because. Remember on search console earlier today where you saw like the indexing like it was indexed. So vast majority of websites especially as they grow. I have a very small percentage of their pages index. I think yours is that like. Maybe 60% or something. Yeah it was almost that it was right around half yep yeah. And he's basically figured out a way to make Google index way more pages with this AI system. So that's one thing he's done and then he's also figured out a way to. Basically auto generate content like blog posts and such to bring people onto the site. And an automated way but that's different from other automated ways. It's distinct because a lot of people right now are like doing the chat GBT blogs just. Hey right me a vlog about why son is a good for you. And so he set up is a whole system that goes in like does a deep research on like questions people are asking in the market. Across maybe four of these different things like that like what are people currently like asking in the market. And then it basically. Research is the topics and then build really in depth content that Google doesn't flag unlike a lot of other stuff so actually. And so we're working with him we're trying to get that set up pretty soon. I'm not screen sharing anymore. Let me show you. And that does what you're doing that that does bring up something like. You know I asked chat GBT about sauna and perspire came up you know which is one of our competitors but we didn't so you know Google is one aspect of it but being recognized by AI search engines. Is obviously the future so if there's a way for us to get ahead of that as a franchise that is definitely something we've invested. I'm so glad you said that you jumped a gun exactly what I was going to say that's that's another part of what you figured out is indexing for. And then we're going to have a chance to be a T search and another one take one call for complexity I don't think we've heard of that. Yeah, Apple's looking at complexity they might buy it. Yeah, I just all that news yesterday yeah. That would be very interesting. And you know trying to get that integrated so we're talking with him about how that would work on. With your guys the system because you have. It's a good place and go high level so we're working with him on that trying to figure that out but I'm really excited for that and I'm wondering if that would be a good use of doing as a brand. Yeah, that would be an individual so that would for sure benefit everybody and definitely want to be ahead of this I mean it's not slowing down obviously the the AI stuff it's. Yeah, yeah, just personally I I rarely Google anymore I'm talking to chat GPT way more often. Yeah, it's just that's the future so I you know you either had a bit of behind it. Exactly super glad you're on board with that yeah we're trying to get that integrated. I'll be really exciting. You guys they do is in the first like 10 days of setting it up they go and do the research in January like 90 blogs they get posted in the first 30 days so they post like wow yeah day and they get them all out there so it's it's done a lot they've. They've been helping a lot of websites works out. So there's a name I don't even know is a silly search in optimization and there's another. So there's another worker a eo it's like answer optimization so answer engine optimization that's what AI part comes in so most of the website is trying to optimize their content for a eo this is what this that's the. The AI people are trying to read you they get content from you even journey right so it's like a simple but it's just a. Cool. Yeah so I think that's an exciting one but yeah I think if there's any other thoughts about us now but otherwise we're going to get get executing this week. Yeah yeah things rolling sounds perfect well thank you guys again for the extra time today and.

Copywriting Guide:

 Okay, hello everyone. Welcome to this presentation. This presentation entitled The Fundamentals of Writing to Sell. Now, if you're watching this, I'm hoping that you're from the Copyright In Collective Discourse Server. If you're watching this and you're not from the Copyright In Collective Discourse Server, then I'd highly recommend you join. I'm sure you can find a link somewhere online or by contacting the person who gave you this video. But long story short, it's the second anniversary of when we founded the server. It's a great place for aspiring copyrighters, veteran copyrighters, marketers, marketers, and anyone interested in the tools of persuasion to hang out and debate and share opinions and ship posts and many other valuable things I'm sure we'll all agree. Now, this presentation is effectively a summary of all the important points I have learned over the last few years while I've been launching and building my career in marketing. So let's crack into it. First of all, I'd like to show you this. This is a demonstration of the power that Copywriting holds and the ability to grasp the fundamentals of good copywriting really can have this impact on any business that you work with. On the left, we can clearly see the results. This is in the back end of Wukomas. These are the sales results of a business that I am still working with. This was in the month before I started working with them. Before they had applied any of these fundamentals of copywriting and advertising and on the right was in the month after I started working with them after the contract had been signed. You can see the difference just in the height of the bars but if you look at the figures on the left, the one that shows pretty the biggest impact. If you look at that average net daily sales went from £124 to just over £600. That's almost gone up fivefold in the matter of a few days over two months really. I didn't perform any kind of a wizardry to get these results. There wasn't a huge technical strategy change or anything like that. This really just was using an existing businesses channels and the assets that they had and applying the fundamental principles of copywriting, of good copywriting to them to really pump up results. That's all this was and you can see the results feel self-hier. Hopefully this is just to demonstrate what kind of effect this can have in such a short space of time. I promise you that if you take these lessons to heart and you think on them and you explore and you are curious and you're empathetic and you really go beyond the brief to try to try and act these results for your clients and for your projects you will be able to do it. I was in the exact same position as you a few years ago not really understanding copywriting and now to be able to pull out results like this for businesses within the matter of a month is it's yeah it feels great. But what can you expect? What can you expect from this presentation? From this presentation you can really expect that you're going to have a proven system for writing the best performing copy on any project. That was really my goal with this when I was an originally creating it. I wanted to give something that was as practical as possible and gave as many concrete answers as I could to questions about how to research and how to write copy and how to edit. Rather than just talking about theory you know we do go into theory of course because we have to do and it's super important and you need to set up that workbench first before you start using the tools on it but I did also want to give a system and the system that I use to write the copy that serves me well. So that's what you can expect from this you can expect a full-fetched system for how to write copy but not just on emails and not just for ads and not just for sales pages. I try to really break down the principles of writing to sell and persuasion and psychology and how people react to advertising. I really try to get to the core of what I have seen over the last three years work and not work and show you well okay these are the kinds of things you need to consider no matter what campaign you're working on no matter what medium you're writing for at the end of the day you're writing to people and people are persuaded in certain ways so I've really tried to stick to holistic view of how to persuade people online and through copy not just through a particular type which you could argue is not as good because some people will want to know specifically about emails and that's absolutely fine but when I teach people especially if you're new and especially when I'm teaching teams who need to be on the same page about things I really just want to give you the fundamentals of how you should be thinking about persuading people in the first place before you get lost you know in the nitty gritty of oh should I use this formula or should I use that formula or how should I position this like first of all we just need to talk about the fundamentals of persuasion in copy writing so that's what you can expect from this presentation we first need to discuss the problem with copy writing and why a lot of digital marketers fail there's no better place to start than with a quote from my all time favorite copywriter Gary Benzavenga and the quote is never sell something just because you want to sell it or indeed never advertise something simply in the way that you want to advertise it that quote is I would argue the most important quote you will ever hear in the field of copywriting and the reason being is because whenever we're looking at marketing and whenever we're looking at sales or copywriting we're ultimately looking at persuasion and persuasion needs to start with the person on the other end of the ad not you that is the crucial step to to first kind of take to understand this field uh most marketing underperforms because copywriters are taught to write for the company not for the prospect when I give this presentation I'm usually giving it to a team I'm usually giving it to teams of people who already work in businesses and already have a structure in place and perhaps on the surface it seems more suited to say something like this there but it's just a suit it to someone who is a freelancer and is looking to learn the fundamentals that are actually going to help them with marketing because whenever you're writing for a client you're trying to please two people you're trying to please the target audience but you're also trying to please the client themselves you need them to be happy with it and that's a huge problem and I'm not going to focus on that because if you spend time trying to please the client then you're not necessarily going to write the best ad I understand that sometimes that's an necessity and you know need must so if that's what you need to do to earn money that's what you need to do but I don't want to teach you about how to make it as a freelancer I want to teach you about how to write good ads and this concept of most marketing underperforming because copyrighters are not writing for the prospect themselves and when I say prospect I mean the reader because they're not writing for the reader and instead they're writing to please the company that they work for or their boss or the client it doesn't do well and it's a key problem it's probably the biggest problem that I see in the world of marketing and it's not necessarily limited to trying to please a boss or trying to please a client oftentimes as Gary Vance of Engels says it's people trying to please themselves and thinking in ways that hey I would like to advertise something this way or hey I would like to talk about this point because I would buy it if it was talking about this point you know we are trapped inside our own heads and it's difficult for us to see other people's perspective sometimes but it's a key thing to break out of if we want to be a good copywriter we need to understand that we're not writing for ourselves and we're not writing for a client and we're not writing for a company or a boss we're writing for the reader for the prospect and I'd like to demonstrate this in probably a way that some of you may be surprised with because I'm going to show you a television advert now this television advert is a perfectly example of something that has been written for a client a company to please a boss or to please someone who it has made it rather than thinking about the person who's actually going to respond to the ad. Okay good fun that was the ad for the Nissan 300 ZX I'm not a car person so I don't know what I just said but that's what it was it cost $200 million to produce and buy the space for on television it was named as commercial of the year by time magazine ad week and USA today and it was praised publicly by Oprah Winfrey and Jerry Seinfeld. However, US sales of the model that's advertised in the sad went down 37% in the year after it aired and the model was completely taken off the US market a year later it was great for Cheat who was the advertising agency that came up with this ad but not so much for Nissan and adverts purpose is to sell. That's it there is no debate on that topic if an ad campaign isn't helping a product to sell then it's not succeeding as an ad and that is a concept that a lot of people outside advertising and unfortunately some people inside advertising seem to struggle with and this is a prime offender of this concept this ad was entertaining it was new I imagine it was inspired by toy story so it was fun and people loved it and people with oh so that was a great ad the problem is when people say that was a great ad it doesn't usually mean that it was actually a very good ad because people want to be entertained most of the time and they're not thinking about what market is thinking about market is should be thinking about how many sales that is pulling but people are just thinking about how yeah I enjoyed that the question really needs to be you may have enjoyed it but did you go out and buy a Nissan 300 ZX no then not such a great ad and this was the problem that it had I want to show you another ad right now and I've got the came out in the same year as this one and we're going to watch it and then we're going to discuss it afterwards if you were to take every monitor every award everything positive that's been said about the Toyota camera and leave them end to end you probably ask yourself why do I do that without compacting savings why not least one for as little as 229 a month and come up with a few accolades of your own the 1996 camera the gold standard from Toyota that ad was for the Toyota camera in the same year 1996 is the first one I watched now that ad was not recognized as a higher award winning advert you'll be high press to find any discussion about it online I certainly couldn't it was never praised as revolutionary in fact I I can't even remember how many views it has on YouTube I'd imagine most of them are from me at this point however US sales of the model were up by over 350,000 which is over 8% throughout the lifespan of the ad and it was the best ever year for sales of the model it actually became the second highest in sales for a foreign car model in the US ever now if we compare those results to the results of the first ad that we looked at I think we can say with with certain confidence which one performed better as an ad which one actually made more people by the car that it was representing at this point some of you may be confused because some of you may already have looked into advertising a little bit you may already know a little bit about copyright online and think why am I showing you television adverts I'm showing you television adverts not because they're a good example of copyrighting that we're going to be looking at but because they are the most recognizable kind of advertising ever or certainly with with our generations you know we all grew up with televisions and if you ask someone to think of an advert or a commercial you know the first thing they think of is television that is what their mind goes to and what we've discussed so far about focusing on the prospect and focusing on what the prospect wants can be perfectly demonstrated in television ads in the biggest way possible and on the largest scale possible and that really is why all of this is relevant to you we're not looking at television ads I'm not even going to suggest that that second ad we looked at was an amazing ad and as we'll discuss in a moment there's no way for us to actually say whether that ad caused those sales to go up we can't actually work that out and we're coming to discuss that in a moment but all of this is relevant to you because you need to understand the difference between an advert that people say is good and an advert that actually is good and the truth is this anti market focus this this anti prospect anti reader focus is even worse today in the digital age and it's because things like brand awareness likes, reacts, shares, comments and engagement are branded around as if they are what matters when it comes to advertising people seem to think that likes and global reach equate to success in sales and they don't at the end of the day like we said if an ad isn't bringing sales it is not succeeding as an ad and that's what we need to remember but today you'll see far more people boast and celebrate the fact that they hit a benchmark in likes or they hit a benchmark in shares or comments or a certain type of react I have been in meetings where a whole slides of presentations have been dedicated to the difference in reacts on Facebook posts and it doesn't matter it does not matter sure maybe that's something afterwards you can have a look at and see if it correlates to anything in any way but if you're talking about things like that before you even mention sales then you're wasting potential of your campaigns and for the next well obviously I say for the next two days for the next however many hours we're going to push these ideas out of our minds because we don't care about these things and as we saw in those television adverts in that first one it was named add of the year and it got all these rewards and it received all this public recognition well it's even worse today because back then the only real way there's something could receive recognition was by winning an award that would then get circulated in magazines on television on chat shows or whatever but now in the age of social media marketers can claim success because X number of people watch their video or X number of likes were given on this post or it reached as many people or it made its way into 10% more countries or whatever the case may be there are far more opportunities for people to celebrate what I call vanity metrics things that don't really make a difference to sales and it's dangerous especially if you're working with people in companies who get paid salaries whose jobs don't rely on the success or failure of a campaign in sales they just get paid a certain amount and then they can try and frame as much as they can as a win by bringing up these things as likes and reacts and chairs and whatever it be in fact if you go on to many advertising agencies websites and you go to their case study section you will see a lot of them bring up points like gain 50% likes or got X number of more followers and those are the things they talk about most in some cases that's all they talk about and they never talk about sales or or acquisitions you know measurable metrics that we're going to discuss in the presentation so as I said we're going to push these ideas out of our mind and we're going to talk about the thing that actually matters when it comes to marketing sales and by consequence the fundamentals of writing to sell that is what we care about how do we write copy that actually gets people to buy things and to begin to understand this we need to look at the difference between two schools that advertising in direct response and direct response there's a key difference between this too perhaps you've already heard of them but even within people who have heard of direct response versus indirect response there still seems to be semantic arguments and a lack of understanding over what they actually mean so it's easy to show you some examples and then explain the difference these are some examples of indirect response ads you can see the first ad that we looked at in the top left this has a bias towards British advertising so if you're if you live in the UK you may recognize some of these but I'm sure you'll you'll you get the gist of what they are these ads are television posters sometimes tweets and things of that nature I'm not going to tell you what makes them indirect response just yet you may already know but what I want to do is show you direct response and these are some direct response ads by the way when I say the word ad I don't necessarily mean paid ad I'm just talking about a form of advertising just to clear that up now so it could be pages or emails or whatever so these are some direct response ads hell of a lot more text I'm sure you agree for the most part probably looks a lot more boring to most people and there is one key difference between the two that you will see on pretty much all of these ones but none of these and the difference is a media action direct response ads have buttons and forms and coupons they have ways for you to immediately respond to the ad they are trying to get you to do something straight away in the digital age this is most commonly seen with a link with a button with something we can see in the in the top middle a form to fill out in the middle left we have a Spotify banner ad which says try premium free it's clearly a link it's getting you to do something now but if we look at indirect response none of these are asking you to do something immediately and they're not giving you a way to do something immediately they may be suggesting hey buy our product but if someone sees that poster in the in the top of the middle and they go out and buy a bottle of gettle bottle of disinfectant how do you know that they came from that ad or is because of that ad you have no idea and that's the key difference a media action because direct response is only bothered about getting people to react to things in a measurable way with any of these ads they can clearly be tracked if someone clicks a button software kicks in and it will tell you hey this number of people saw this ad and this number of people click the button in the newspaper ads that you can see there are things that can be cut out there are specific numbers to be called that are dedicated just to that specific ad so they can tell exactly how many people saw the ad and how many people called or responded or sent something in or filled out for that is the point that is the difference between indirect response and direct response but where people get confused is people seem to think that direct response is a style they seem to think that these kinds of ads have a style to them and some of them may have a style to them but they consider that direct response they consider that conversational tone direct response that is not what direct response means direct response is an objective it means I want to respond I want someone to respond to this directly it's simply an objective it is not a style it is not a conversational way of writing it's not a particular way of structuring your copy or paragraph structure or having one sentence per line or anything like that direct response is simply an objective I want someone to do something straight away but I can measure that is what direct response means so if you're ever in argument with someone and you're trying to defend direct response do not think that you're defending a particular style of writing you are just defending a particular objective in advertising you'll also see people say that indirect response is ineffective and it's not worth it and there seems to be a tribal war sometimes between direct response copywriters and indirect response copywriters mainly it's direct response copywriters with egos that are a bit too big trying to shit on people who do indirect response but this isn't the case either indirect response is not ineffective in the right hands it is very effective and the biggest companies in the world like Nike like Cadbury McDonald's bowking all these huge companies Amazon partake in indirect response advertising whether they're not asking anyone to do anything straight away they're not giving you an option to do something straight away they're just saying hey look we exist and it can be used to great effect in many many campaigns so please do not think that indirect response is not valuable or is not effective because it's not true and in fact we have a couple of extremely talented indirect response copywriters otherwise some people call them brand copywriters in the copywriters so just want to clear that up as well anyway I felt I'm getting sidetracked it I know I know I'm getting into some antics but yeah we know the difference is a media action so anyway second about what we're talking about what is the problem with so much modern copywriting well despite what I just said a moment ago and despite my slight defense of indirect response the problem with modern copywriting or a much modern copywriting is that it takes inspiration from the wrong school of advertising it does take inspiration from indirect response and for most of who actually need to make money as copywriters and our freelaunchers and need to work with clients and businesses and improve results taking inspiration from indirect response is a mistake and you shouldn't do it especially if you're learning especially if you're starting out the only indicator of good copy is its measurable results and in marketing this ultimately means sales and as we've discussed the only way to precisely measure results of an ad is for that ad to be direct response for it to give a clear and obvious action that the reader needs to take and then see how many people follow through with action and that being the case it means that if you're a copywriter or an aspiring copywriter and you want to know that you are learning the best principles and things that actually work you need to take inspiration from direct response advertising adds that live or die by their ability to sell end of story you need to take inspiration from direct response and you need to study direct response especially as a beginner direct response advertising equal the fundamentals that we need to write to sell so why is an every agency focusing on direct response copywriting why is it a relatively underground term that doesn't crop up in the mainstream much well simply put it's because a lot of agencies and a lot of marketing agencies don't need to have that level of success they don't need to be insanely obsessed with learning about direct response and learning about selling because a lot of agencies don't actually need to make many increases in results to get paid a lot of agencies just work with clients who are happy to get more followers or to increase brand awareness or to have a cool new looking campaign it's often more of a vanity exercise than anything else agencies who pay their copyright salaries again not all of them of course there are many amazing direct response agencies there are many agencies that do take inspiration of direct response and use this as training but a lot of agencies especially it ones I've worked with in the past as well they just employ people who are quote unquote good at writing and that's that they go okay way of cool they're good at writing they're quite creative they're entertaining they'll be good in the advertising department cool so the reason that every advertising agency isn't talking about direct response and the reason you may not have heard of it too many times before is because they don't really need to that they're often on big contracts where the businesses they work with don't need to see a huge jump in results they don't need to increase sales 10fold for it to have an impact they are in salary jobs that are relatively cushy that don't always require loads of hard fought and hard won research to establish so that's why you often see this type of advertising a direct response mainly being popular among freelancers and people who are kind of what underground and go into businesses and do consulting work so anyway direct response advertising very important and this is what we are focusing on this is what this presentation is about it's how to take advantage of direct response copywriting all right so we've spoken about direct response advertising and white important but copywriting specifically what are we trying to do when we write copy what is the forever rule of copywriting well there is one i would argue this is probably the best way to think about copywriting the role of your copy is to connect your product to your prospect dominating conscious desire using only your advertising message so i'm going to say that again connect your product to your prospect dominating conscious desire using only your advertising message that is the role of copy now that may seem like a fairly obvious phrase but it's also a very clear phrase it has a very precise meaning in other words if you need it if you need it and said in another way you need to talk about what people already have in their own heads what they're thinking about and that's all you have to work with really you need to show them that your product or whatever it is the your advertising can help whatever it is that they care about that's kind of that's kind of it and we'll come on to you know how to apply this in a moment but remembering this phrase is going to help you keep that mission clear in your head and while a million things are trying to fight for your attention on a campaign you can always bring it back to this phrase and go am I actually doing this if yes good if i'm not I need to rethink how i'm how i'm writing this copy and how i'm moving forward this project because most marketers and businesses focus on what they like about their product not what it means to the customer so if you can remember this phrase it will put you ahead of 90% of marketers who are working today particularly those who are in agency level jobs and and who are just being paid a salary who get who lights get distracted by by shiny objects and trends if you can remember this then you are the reason that the business you're working for is focused and is concentrating and is winning results and it really brings it back to the beginning and what the you know the first thing we said the first thing that Gary Benzavenga so kindly brought up for us which is that you should never advertising something and never advertise something simply in the way that you want to advertise it you need to make sure you're focusing on the prospect how any prospect decides what they're going to buy because we can sit here or we like and talk about good ads and we can talk about things that seem to work in marketing but if we don't discuss how decisions actually get made and how people make buying decisions these are three books fascinating books i would highly recommend you read them i'm not going to do a detail breakdown of them right now but they give a good view a good insight into behavioral economics and consumer psychology and how humans and and and an an an an an an an a broad sense and that just to how humans behave and why we behave in certain ways very interesting books uh like i said i'm not going to go into everything that they they teach but i am going to bring up five general rules that they seem to gravitate around and rules that countless marketing tests and psychological studies seem to prove time and time again bear in mind these are just general rules there are always exceptions not they won't work in every context but their things that we should keep in mind and they are as follows one our brains are wired to categorize things immediately two the longer we take to make decisions the less confident about than we are three we rely on herd mentality more than we'd like to admit for logic is secondary and five decision making is based on emotion now each of these are important in their own right and you will see uh these concepts and and shoot off concepts uh crop up in the rest of this presentation and in marketing out there in the real world but right now it is that last one that we really care about it's that last one that is is probably the most important decision making is based on emotion not logic not reason we are not rational creatures who sit down and consider every possibility and every avenue before we land on a decision our brains are wired to categorize things immediately as the first point points out we have evolved to make quick judgments and to make snap decisions because if we don't make snap decisions we don't survive so our brains in all things like to work out what it is and have a decision to land on something so we know how to respond to it and that's why emotion is so important because emotion has developed to uh to take from past experiences that we've had and things that we know we already hold dear or that we already care about and bring those up whenever a decision needs to be made so we can quickly make it there's there's a potential to get into another semantic argument here about exactly what emotion means in the context of copyrighting I'm going to tell you what I believe it means and what I found it most helpful to to imagine when I'm talking about emotions emotions are anything that your prospect knows that they already care about so it's anything they already have within them inside of them that if you bring up they're already immediately interested because they view it as relevant so whatever it is that they already care about in some way whether that be a problem so a pain that they have whether it be a desire something they want whether it be a deeply held belief whether it be prejudice whatever it is if it's inside them and they already care about in some way or have some stake in it then that is emotional and that's what you're trying to tap into trying to tap into those emotions so whenever we're advertising whenever we're writing copy and we're trying to to get someone to read it then we're trying to get their attention and make sure that we get them on on our side there's another phrase that we can use to to remember what we're trying to do we're trying to join the conversation already happening in their head we want to pick on points that they already know they care about we don't want to make them do work we don't want to bring up brand new angles that they may not have thought of before in subjects that they don't particularly care about and try to make them care about it rarely does that work it's very difficult to do instead we want to take things that they already care about that they already identify with that they already have problems in or desires of and we want to bring those up because we know that's a surefire way to get people to listen to what we have to say and if you need a way to visualize this when we're advertising a product this is effectively what we're doing there are set number of facts about a product you know take an iPhone for example the the product of products there is a camera that has a certain level of quality there are different colors there are storage sizes there is the fact that it has a touch screen of different sizes different internals each year it gets better it only has one button they remove the headphone jack whatever it is there are many many facts that we could stay and we could list about the iPhone and many of those could be points to advertise we could twist them in certain ways to make them feel more appealing and we'll come on to how to do things like that in the rest of this presentation but for right now we just need to accept that there are many different facts that we could focus on when writing advert about an iPhone but let's say we're advertising to someone there are beliefs and problems and desires that this person will already have and this is the circle on the right that we're looking at on this diagram they already have things that they know they care about they have issues that they want to fix they have desires that they they want that the things that they they feel like they're missing out on and they have deep-held beliefs and opinions and what we're trying to do as a marketer is hit that sweet spot in the middle where these two circles cross over where we can take an objective fact about our product and we can twist it in an emotionally appealing way to line up with something that they also already care about so let's say for example that the thing that our person really cares about is or the problem they feel they have is that the quality of cameras the quality of photos that they take is not where they wanted to be and it's annoying and they can never get the the style right they'd like to go on hikes at night and take photos of the sky but they always come out crap to them bringing up the new colors of the iPhone may not work probably wouldn't be bothered about the new colors of the iPhone and if that's the thing that they first see about it and that's the thing they hear a lot they're going to ignore it because it doesn't cross over into that middle section however if we can talk about the new camera of the iPhone and talk about how amazing it is and how it's been especially tampered to a tampered with to take photos the night sky all of a sudden it becomes far more relevant to them because it's fixing a problem that they already have so even though we could select one of an infinite number of facts about our product we want to try and get the one crosses over into something they already care about again this may seem completely obvious to you and I hope it does because it you know it should to a certain degree because it just seems well yeah this is how we you know of course we should show people what they care about but so many times we gloss over this simple fact and I'm going to show you three examples just from my person I will talk to from my person experience and one from a not even from a marketing context of where this just doesn't happen and what people don't do this is do this and businesses don't even think to this level about how to advertise their goods so I'm going to show you three examples on the left side of the screen you're going to see the original version of whatever it is that I'm showing you we'll call this the control which means the best performing version up to that point in reality these things hadn't been tested before but on the left it's the control the thing that was already there on the right we're going to have the thing that replaced it and we're also going to show you the the conversion rates of them and how well they did this first one is actually an example of the business I showed you at the very beginning which those results were it was showing how effective copyright can be that's this is the business that the that where those results were taken from on the left we had their initial landing page because version it was about 1.15 of people who saw it ended up clicking the button and what clicking the button yeah that was it which is a bit of a business as a business really low on the right we had the version that replaced it the the i-roats after conducting research and you can see the conversion rate again about 10 what the original was this is a prime example of the difference between just writing something for the sake of it and just kind of going yeah that seems like it will be okay it kind of makes sense yeah that sounds nice versus looking at what prospects actually care about and finding that crossover between a fact about the product or the service and an emotion of the prospect on the left helping your hive to thrive and survive that is clearly fluff copy what i would call fluff copy it's just what someone has gone yeah that rhymes that sounds good oh yeah i should probably explain what this business even is it's a it's a it's a pub and bar supplier in the UK so that they help pubs and bars get snacks basically for the best possible price they sell to them um on the left you can just see it was clearly something that someone's in well yeah that's kind of described what we do and it's pretty generic and yeah rhymes cool that'll be enough when i conducted research for this business what i found was that one of the biggest complaints about um other businesses in this industry were or in this market I should say were how they forced the customer to to lock into contracts that were annoying and complicated and and just generally confusing ones that they found hard to get out of and they didn't quite know how to edit and they weren't sure of exactly what was coming when it was coming that was a big bug bear so i made sure that when we rewrote this landing page we included that we made that front and center the point of the headline so perfect for your pub wholesale prices no confusing contracts the conversion rate seems to have justified that decision and seems to be showing that just by presenting something that the prospect already cares about tapping into that emotion by saying hey look we understand what you're going through we understand your problem we understand what you want just by doing that it's increased results by 10 times and again i'm not even going to comment on if the rest of the copy is amazing or if it could be improved the facts are in front of us just by doing that slot that one thing we are making use of traffic that was otherwise slipping away and just exiting the pages so there you go that's one example of of where emotion first beats over just what i call logic first anything where it's just like yep that sounds good oh yeah that seems logical it seems like that is something that people would care about the difference between assuming and actually doing the research and finding out what care what matters to people this is another example different medium this was a leaflet it was actually the first leaflet that i ever wrote so that was quite fun it was advertising the opening of a vegetarian vegan takeaway in a town and the left the left version was the first leaflet that went out to a selection of about 2000 houses it was just a menu saying you know new listing prices of of the products and showing some photos of the products and approximately 19 orders came back from that we have to say approximately because you know there could have been referrals we don't know we can only track it by the addresses of people who ordered so that's how you know seeing if they came from a certain postcode but anyway that was the that was the first one that was sent out when the business came to me and asked if i could help um i asked myself okay well do people actually care immediately about a vegan vegetarian takeaway is it something people really care about not necessarily if you're vegan vegetarian clearly that's uh that's a link and it's going to be interesting to you so you know we don't really need to worry about uh vegans vegarians because they're just going to to try it out anyway but for most people and for people who we could target what is it that they care about right now why might someone want to have a vegan or vegetarian dish it's not necessarily because they're vegan or vegetarian there might be something else there at the time i think this must have been in February oh no maybe Jan you're actually because i think it was um oh i can't know it did you? Jan you were February in 2021 um do you know how to kingdom where the town was where this leaflet went out was in lockdown and that's something that people really cared about during lockdown they felt guilty about was the fact that they weren't as healthy as they once were and that they gained weight and that they couldn't exercise and they felt like they were having more fast food and takeaways so i thought okay well let's try and play on that let's see if that makes people more likely to order so instead of just saying hey we're a new takeaway order from us we we went with the big um obvious headline how to live healthily off the lockdown again not necessarily an amazing headline but it's hitting on something that people already care about that we know is dear to people uh we then deliver some value i'm not going to discuss everything that's going on this leaflet but we then deliver a bit of free value and then we announce that we're a new takeaway that can can help them out and show them how to order and the website to go to so and then we can of course we can see by the the conversions that the orders that came from it um again are around 10 times as many came in just because we instead of just going well that seems good we'll just do that it was okay well what do people care about right now and linking up the service that we could provide or affect about the product that we had to something that we already knew the prospects we'd care about and then lastly is an example that's outside of marketing and in no way um is drawing any kind of political bias i'd just using this as a very clear example that is anti marketing um this was a television debate that took place between Nick Kleg and Nigel for Arge in uh i've got you know 20 between 2040 and 2016 it would have been one of those years uh the audience the studio audience was asked who won the debate and the debate was about Brexit in the 90 kingdom whether the United Kingdom should leave the European Union um Nick Kleg was widely considered to have had the um better argument in terms of statistics and facts and um projections he was bringing out actual figures and he was talking about trade and um national status and economic repercussions and things that were quite maths based and science based and had clear cut projections behind them and Nigel for Arge spoke about immigration and taking back control of the 90 kingdom and Nigel for Arge pretty much wiped the floor with Nick Kleg and you could obviously argue that it was also about um his ability as an eraser um but ultimately the difference between the two came down to what they spoke about Nigel for Arge concentrated on what people were already thinking about because the hot topics in the Brexit referendum were immigration and um basically EU uh legislation over the 90 kingdom those were the things that were on everyone's lips and that was effectively what triggered the referendum in the first place so whereas Nick Kleg was coming at an angle from hey look these are things that you should care about because they're going to be impactful Nigel for Arge said these are things that I know you already care about so I'm going to talk about these and I'm going to um play on the emotions you're already feeling about them because I'm going to um I'm going to give um an impassioned speech about why they matter and why I'm right on these subjects so again just another example of how tapping into people's emotions and what they already care about and what they already have on their minds is far more effective than talking um about logic and really that's why decision making is emotional that that's what emotional decision making is it's about tapping into the things that people already care about um you know when I say logic and when I was using logic first as uh as the left side of the examples you know logic just means anything that's assumed anything that people think that anyone else should care about anything but someone thinks sounds good because it rines it's all kind of it's never based on research and and it's never grounded in the emotion of the prospects it's always because of some other kind of logic it's always because of hey people should be caring about this thing therefore I'm going to talk about it rather than well I know they already care about it so um that's what I'm going to play on this is not seen anywhere better than in headlines because ultimately emotional decisions are immediate they happen straight away and we need to show the prospect that what we have to say is relevant to them in our first point of contact because they're not going to give you a second chance they're not going to read 100 words before making a decision um our brains are fine tuned to respond to headlines whether it be YouTube videos or Netflix listings or newspaper articles or landing pages or subject lines on emails you know that first block of text that's bigger and bolder than the rest of them is what we are conditioned to judge things on the headline uh and what we'll cover headlines in more detail later on of their presentation and we'll go into what makes them work and and what their purpose is but for this point and the presentation and the proceedings what we're talking about we just need to consider what headlines are doing and and what headlines are doing is that they are forcing our prospect to reach an emotional decision we're forcing our prospects to say yes this is relevant to me or no this is not relevant to me when you look at a headline like this which was for a newspaper ad uh do you make these mistakes in job interviews there are two reactions to this headline oh I I don't know maybe I do make these mistakes in job interviews okay like let's let's have a look or um I'm don't care about job interviews so I'm not going to even bother reading this those are two reactions that you get to that and that first reaction is hopefully going to be mostly given by people who are in between jobs who are worried about how they perform a job interviews and who are considering moving careers soon or trying to do it right now because it's so clearly obvious and relevant to them that they go hey yeah you know what this is on my mind right now I'm going to read and see what you have to say of course you also get people who are just intrigued and that's fine too but the point is it's clearly calling out to the people that this ad is intended to target which is people who are between jobs people who are thinking of moving careers people who do want to feel like yes I want to be confident when I go into job interviews and it tells that story straight away by presenting what the topic is of the ad and if it's going to be relevant to us so even if your headline is repulsing certain people immediately that's fine as well it should do that people should also be able to tell if it's irrelevant to them straight away a headline shouldn't appeal to everyone it should appeal to the target audience of the ad and headlines like this do a great job what you want to avoid and this is and something I want to show you is a bad example an example of where the person clearly doesn't understand that they need to get people to reach an emotional decision that they're trying to tap into existing problems and desires and beliefs this was a genuine headline that I found on Facebook on a Facebook ad as I was scrolling through it's from a cold ad which means that I had had no previous engagements with this company I'd never seen any of their stuff online before nor had I been on their website but it was still targeted at me so it's the first point of contact I'm having with this company I'm not going to name the company the creative above the image was the same as the headline the same words and I think it was just a photo of two women with a piece of paper there was nothing specific or particularly discrepancy about it but the headline reads exes 15 years of experience to help you live your best life what the fuck does that mean I don't know I've never seen this company before I don't know what they do I'm not sure what their product is and this isn't revealing anything to me about their product or service but even worse than that it's not showing me how it's relevant to my life or to my pains or to my desires or to my beliefs I simply don't care so this isn't even repulsing me like in this example if I was happy in a job and I didn't care about job interviews this this repulse is perhaps too strong word but I would be able to clearly see straight away that this is not relevant to me so I can clearly back away from it but this headline it's doing neither it's not attracting me or all repulsing me I don't know anything I I'm not sure this is trying to say and I don't want to give it the time to find out because the brain's default response is to ignore if we don't know what something is and it's not we can't see how it's relevant to us in any way if it's not particularly intriguing then we just ignore it and not only am I ignoring this because I probably am not the target audience but also the target audience of this are also probably ignoring it because nothing there is calling out to an emotion that they already have it's not forcing them to reach an emotional decision it's not calling out to an existing pain or desire or belief it's just there it's just something that someone has clearly gone yet well let's just talk about ourselves and yeah that seems kind of logical because we're saying about how good we are and yeah people like to to live well so yeah we'll put that because that sounds good they've clearly done they've clearly put no effort into researching what prospects actually specifically care about right now now that we know how important that first point of contact is and how crucial it is to meet the customer where they are and to reflect their emotions in our own copy we may be thinking is there an easy way to do that is there a simple process that we can follow to make sure that we're meeting them the same point every single time especially when we first talk to them but also when we continue our sales argument and we continue to write our copy well thankfully there is an easy way to know how to well to know where to start and and how to continue your copy writing and it's the universal prospect journey that's often overlooked in the mainstream mode of marketing and you may have heard of it before but it's something called the stages of awareness and there are five stages of awareness this was a concept first introduced and popularised by Eugene Schwartz in his book Break Through Advertising if you can pick up a copy of Break Through Advertising I'd highly recommend reading well all of it but particularly this section because he'll explain it far better than I do I believe it's in chapter two and he discusses with us how no matter where a prospect is in relation to buying your product whether they are absolutely ready or whether they have never heard of your company before or whether they know of similar products but haven't in experience yours they always fall within one of five stages of awareness and our job as a copywriter is quite simply to move prospects through those stages of awareness so they're ready to buy and they're very easy to remember and they are and we start at the top with unaware if your reader is unaware it means that they don't know that they have a problem that needs solving because ultimately every product is solving a problem whether that be a pain like we've discussed or it's granting a desire or it's tying in with a belief that someone has an and taking advantage of that but regardless a product is always fulfilling something for someone it's always solving a problem and if someone's in the unaware category it means they don't even know that they have a problem that needs to be solved let alone that your product exists typically you won't write to unaware audiences in many markets I personally in e-commerce rarely or I don't think I've ever written to a fully unaware audience there are some markets especially I know in financial publishing where unaware audiences are target audiences relatively often so it differs from market market but most of the time I would say in gigs that you're getting as a freelancer you won't be writing to people who are unaware and they tend to be the most difficult people to to write to and I'm also going to go through what you should be doing when you're writing to these different stages of awareness and giving you examples of it as well the next stage of awareness which is a fairly common one is problemware and this is where you're read a nose they have a problem that needs solving but they don't know of any solutions yet so quite a simple one and again I'll give you an example in a moment then there's solution aware which is your read a nose of solutions that will solve their problem but they don't yet know about your product and how that is also a solution or how it can provide the same solution product aware means your read a nose of your product but isn't fully convinced that they want it yet and most aware is that your read a nose of your product knows exactly what it does and knows they want it so clearly our objective as copyrighters is to move our prospects into that most aware category you can really imagine copywriting as an exercise in moving prospects through the stages of awareness and there is no one place that everyone starts it's not as if you're always going to be writing to a problemware audience you're not always going to be writing to a solution aware audience it differs from campaign to campaign for example if I'm writing to people who have bought the product before or a part of the subscription service or something like that then they're most likely to for well they're definitely going to fall into that product aware or most aware category because they're existing customers therefore I'm not going to try and write to them as if they're a problem aware audience necessarily and similarly if I'm writing to someone who has never heard of a product before and they don't even know that there are products like out there and they don't know the solution but they have a clear problem then they're going to be in that problemware stage so it really differs and we're also going to talk later on about how to identify what stage of awareness someone is in because it all comes down to research at the end of the day so don't worry right now if you're still a bit confused on how to identify that because we're going to come on to talk to it that's talk about it and for the time being let's just look at how you attack each of these stages of awareness if you're writing to someone in the unaware stage you can only appeal to the identity of the reader like I've said you you may never write to anyone who is unaware but the problem with the unaware stage is that people don't know that they have a problem therefore you can only really try to grab their attention and intrigue them by talking about something that they already believe or something that they already are and I'll show you an example of this in a moment with problemware you need to show your reader that you understand their problem and then claim that you have a solution to it so very simple solution aware you need to show your reader that you understand the solution that they're aware of and go on to prove your product achieves it or is even better than that existing solution product aware you need to reiterate your best promises and claims of your product and prove why your product is the best choice for the reader and most aware for people who are basically right on the edge of buying you just need to overcome any fine love jet-shin or show them an offer that they'll find hard to refuse but do you see that in each one of these stages with each objective you are linking to what the product what the prospect already knows and where they already are so each of these stages no matter where they're in you can always do something to join the conversation that's already happening in their head you want to make sure that you hit on the stage of a one is therein and do the right thing linked to it if I am writing to someone who is product aware and they've already heard of the product and they already know what it does I don't want to write to them as if they're in the problem aware stage because they've already been through that they already know that they have a problem and they know their solutions and they know of your product so there's no point of me in tracking back to trying convince them that I understand their problem it's just a waste of words similarly if I am approaching someone who is problem aware and they know that they have an issue with something I don't necessarily want to open with the name of my product and talk about how it's the best because they may not even understand that solutions exist for their problem yet and a product name isn't necessarily going to grab their attention and allow them to understand that I get what their issues are I need to write in the stage where they are like we've said before we need to join the conversation that's already happening in their head we need to make them reach an emotional decision straight away and appeal to their emotions appeal to their problems that arise their beliefs so let me give you some well not real life because I've made these ones up but let me give you some examples of headlines in these different stages of awareness and just to show how universal this is I have chosen an industry that I have never written in before with a product that I know nothing about which is golf just to give you examples of just palby knowing the stage of awareness that someone is in I can craft a headline that's far more relevant no matter what the industry is so for for the purpose of this exercise I have chosen a golf course that allows people to improve their putting game there and why know nothing about golf some of these words may not make sense but probably just I wrote these out quickly to to show as an example of how simple it becomes using the stages of awareness so if someone is unaware that they even have a problem yet and they don't even know that they want to improve their parting game all I can reach out to is their identity so I write club level golfers could be in for a big surprise this September because all that is doing and all I can do at this stage is call out to their identity something that they associate with themselves and intrigue them with obviously with a bit of intrigue but saying something like hey if you read on this may be relevant to you so they may not know that they have a problem yet or know that they want to improve their parting game but the fact that I'm calling out their identity is given me the best chance of getting them to read on so that's why I go over headline like that in the problem or where stage this person will know that they have an issue that for example that their their handy cap is not as low as they want it to be again I think that's a real thing so I write golf pro denies his handy cap cutting method gives club players an unfair advantage I'm not going to go through all the techniques that these headlines are using but you can see there how I'm bringing up the the topic of cutting a handy cap and I'm applying I'm the implicit promise that I'm giving to people is that if you read on you're going to find out something about how to cut your handy cap and I know you care about that right now so that's why we use a headline like that in solution aware where we say that people understand that to cut their handy cap they need to be better at putting and they know that that's the solution to their problem I hit on that straight away with a really simple headline how to sharpen your short game no additional equipment needed obviously that last bit is just a you know a suffix that's doing something else but you can see that I'm hitting on the solution straight away by bringing up I understand that you know what to do and I'm going to show you how to do it in an add like that when that's my headline that's when I would typically go on to introduce my product relatively quickly because I know that they're already solution aware and they're already looking out for things that can provide that solution or better things that can provide that solution if someone is product aware so they have heard about my course that I'm selling I will bring it up in the in the headline so I say achieve a flat stick mastery in just two weeks and like we said in the product or stage we want to reiterate the best claims and promises of our product so I'm introducing a time frame and saying look you can have this been two weeks I'm allowing people to imagine oh wow I can have this huge benefit I could achieve this flat stick mastery which is also the name of the course in a very specific time frame and a short enough time frame for me to imagine having it now so I'm reiterating a promise of my product and then most aware for people who've heard of the product and they know they want it they may just have a slight objection it could be anything in this case we'll say it's the uncertainty of it working and they just want to know that they're they're cashier safe and they're not blowing any money we we open with a very clear offer 100% refund if you don't lose at least five strokes within a single month so there we're we're pretty much putting our skin in the game and saying hey we know you like this we I've joined in the conversation that's happening ahead because I know you've already wanted and we're also providing this guarantee for you so you don't need to worry if it doesn't work and then you can see some real life or you know um uh made up but uh examples of how the stages of awareness work in a headline I know I'm only talking about headlines now because we've been speaking about the emotional decision and the importance of joining the conversation that's happening in someone's head straight away but the stages of awareness can also be used to guide the rest of your copy which is something we'll come on to look at as we go on the presentation but for the time being we just need to see how headlines and how at first point of contact with our copy can be made so much better and easier and we can take the randomness away by following the stages of awareness and for the sake of clarity I've also given some real life examples of headlines I've seen out about some I've written or not some maybe two I've written to show you where they would come in these stages usually this is a bit of an interactive section where I ask people if they can identify them but for the sake of it I've just shown you what they are so you can kind of have a look around at your own leisure so pause it now and have a have a view and see if you can work out why these headlines fall into that particular category but just to give you a couple of examples let's have a look at one that could fall into two of the stages of awareness because something else that's important is a headline could function in one or more stages of awareness so we take take a look at the second one down on the left stream clearly with acts balls unique sound wave 2.0 technology that could be for someone who is problem aware because they know they have a problem of streaming clearly and that's what they want to do or with someone who is solution aware and they know that they need a better mic and that is going to be the key to solving their problem and in both cases we're joining the conversation is happening in their head because we're giving them something to grab hold of because they can understand there that their problem is they want to stream more clearly but the solution also is that oh I need a better mic and we're fulfilling both those things within this headline so that could double in stages of awareness and you may find that other ones I've put the only fallen to one stage of awareness could also double into other stages of awareness if the audience is right for it and then you take the one of the bottom left as well how to avoid the biggest mistake new real estate investors make well that could be for someone who's problem aware clearly if someone is a new real estate investor and they're worried about something and so it's quite a broad headline but if they're worried and they really don't want to make a mistake and they feel like they're having a problem of about confidence then clearly that headline fits but also it could work for someone who's unaware who they can only grab onto their identity because we are calling out directly this is for new real estate investors even if you don't think you have a problem if you're a new real estate investor you may be interested in reading this so it could also double as an unaware headline as well and then one last one just so we have covered all of the all of the stages or most of the stages anyway most aware I which probably do the prior to where one as well but I will look at the third one down the left most aware vapes and off dog-down dry shampoo that is a really simple headline we are giving a very clear offer saying hey you should get this now because there's an offer on there's a clear reason there's a discount and we're just naming the product so clearly that's for someone who already knows that they want the product and it's just waiting for something else to give them a little much potentially that could also double for someone who's product aware as well but if they're a point where they're considering buying it they're likely in that most aware stage anyway they're just waiting for for something to nudge them over and then if we look at the product aware just to complete the circle on the top right there dance 5k to 1 mil change my life Sarah X homemade. Well we can clearly see there that it's for someone who already knows about the course because we're leading with the course's title and we are giving proof we're reiterating a claim that yes this changes people's lives and like I say this is doubling is proof because it's a direct testimonial from someone as well so hopefully all that uh make sense and why are the stages of awareness so important like I say if you feel my explanation hasn't been satisfactory I'd highly recommend getting hold of Eugene Schwartz's breakthrough advertising uh reading through I believe chapter two where he goes through it and you can you can kind of look back through it your own leisure but the stages of awareness are so important because as I mentioned it takes the randomness out of copywriting it allows us to be confident in where we're starting and what we're doing at any stage of the copy we can always look back at the research we've done and go okay what stages awareness at this person is this person in right I know I need to do this then and if we know that someone is problem aware then we can even follow the stages of awareness down to show right what we need to introduce them to the solution and then our product and then make our product the best one that's you know we need to make it clear it's the best one for them we'll come on to exactly how that happens you know it's not like it has to take a certain amount of words or a certain amount of time people can jump through the stages of awareness within a few sentences other times it takes a whole paragraph, whole pages, whole documents so it really differs from campaign to campaign but the important thing is we understand where someone is starting out and we know that we have to guide them forward to get them to that most aware stage so that is why the stages of awareness are so important and this section wouldn't be complete without me just showing you some genuine real life in all their glory examples of where advertisers clearly understand what stage of awareness they're starting in and what they're trying to appeal to will only take a few of these as an example look at the bottom right for a product called snow which is a teeth white and in kit 15% off photo of the product and also a photo of the product being used clearly this is for someone who already knows what the product is they they obviously know they have a problem they want their teeth to be nicer they want to feel more confident themselves perhaps so we're not trying to appeal to that because we're not talking about what this product does it's for someone who already knows what the product is and probably knows that they want it as well so this is either that product or most aware stage most likely most aware because we're leading with 15% off there is no other copy on that creative and we're just reiterating the point about how is the most advanced teeth whitening system so it comes up to someone who is in those highest stages of awareness who are who are nearly ready to buy but then we go right down to the other end of the spectrum and we look at the top left have you taken out a loan credit card or mortgage and that was a television ad which again won't have won't necessarily have a direct call to action that can be measured it may have a specific number but it may not so we can see how this doesn't the stages of awareness don't just work in direct response we can use them to strengthen any kind of advertising but if we look at the top left ad that's not presenting a problem immediately nor is it presenting a product or a solution to a problem it's simply calling out the audience who may be watching if I have taken out a loan before or a credit card or a mortgage I can see that this might be relevant to me so I'm going to continue watching because this is the first point of contact that I've had and it's calling out something I can identify with or I can identify with having done so that again clearly the unaware stage is what that is calling out to it's not presenting a problem or a solution it's just calling out to people and then one last one we'll look at the bottom left 28 day keto diet plan 100 percent made for beginners okay well who do you think that's for what stage of awareness is that made for it's not for someone who's unaware clearly because it's presenting a solution it's not for someone who is problem aware because it isn't actually bringing up a problem it's not presenting oh do you feel fat or do you feel like you need to gain weight instead it's for someone who is solution aware because it's for people who already know about keto diets and what they do it's about for people who already understand about the solution but clearly it's not product aware because it's not mentioning a product we're just introducing people and saying hey we understand where you are we're joining the conversation that's happening in your head because we know that you've heard of keto plans before and this is a really good one and then it gives a bit more information saying it's made for beginners so this is made for people who have you never taken a keto diet plan before this is for you so clearly that is in the solution aware stage right the secret weapon most marketers are afraid to use so by this point we know the purpose of our copy we know what our job should be as a copywriter we know how people make decisions and we understand the importance of provoking an immediate response but now it's time to learn the last part of theory while setting up our workbench on which we are going to eventually research and write and edit but so far just by having a clear understanding of what we've already been through will make you a better copywriter than most it gives you an advantage over marketers who still follow the doctrine of indirect response advertising or who think too logically or rely on randomness and unnecessary entertainment to get by certainly in my career recently and as I'm working with more agencies and businesses and people I have to work with I guarantee that just understanding of things we've already spoken about will take you beyond them but having this next weapon in your arsenal will take you up to the top 5% before we've even spoken about the actual writing process this single thing is what the top director response agencies in the world use to win a campaign after campaign and it may seem counterintuitive at first glance but because it seems counterintuitive many marketers are scared to use it the scared of even testing it but I promise you if you can get past that that uncomfortable feeling of trying something that seems illogical you will have the most powerful strategy for writing copy that converts it's a thing that you should apply to every single piece of copy you write regardless of where you're writing it or what it's for and the label that those at the top most widely recognised this concept by is the rule of one and for our purposes it can be remembered with a simple acronym albeit an acronym that doesn't actually form a word reo and before I discuss what reo it is and what it means I just want to point out that this is something that most direct response successful direct response marketers will use in one way or another with slight variations between them this is the acronym I use it's the one that I found most useful when I was starting out and I still refer back to it when I'm teaching juniors because I think it sets out in the most easy to understand way but other people will just talk about the rule of one as a general concept other people have different acronyms for it so bear in mind that it's a very similar thing to what most good direct response copywriters have in their arsenal but this is just my take on it and what I found to be the most useful so reo it stands for one reader one idea one offer and one action each piece of copy you write should encompass these things but more importantly than that they must only touch on one of each of them but why well two reasons one it keeps your advertising message organized so you can better understand what is driving your prospect and what they've already been exposed to and two which is which is more important a confused mind or an overwhelmed mind doesn't buy it's a fact that the more messages you throw at someone the less likely they are to understand your main point or the less likely they are to view it as important and subsequently the less likely they are to take action in a moment we'll go through each of the aspects in turn and I'll delve deeper into exactly what each one is doing but the overview and and those two reasons you know messaging and organization and not overwhelming the reader I just really important to understand as the reasons we even use this concept and as we go through each of the points you'll see just how deep these reasons go and what effect they have on your aim of converting prospects so one reader what does one reader mean what does it mean to focus on one reader well your copy must be written as if it's aimed at one person specifically why is it important because it focuses your messaging based on your research and attracts only those who align themselves with the idea of your product meaning the copy that you write will be far more persuasive for your perfect prospects rather than mild and forgettable for all those you read it and example of this and again this isn't copy but this is just an example of who a what who one reader might be when I'm writing copy I'll write this landing page as if the only person who we reading it is a 50 year old mum who's had back pain that's been getting progressively worse over the last decade and who is only just getting time back to themselves after the kids have moved away she hates exercise because it's painful but feels guilty for not being more active now we'll go into how we get this information and the research we do and a lot more about our perfect prospect or our ideal client later on for the time being though all you need to remember is that that's the kind of mindset we have to have when writing anything it doesn't mean we're going to be ultra specific and start writing things like you know aren't you glad that both of your kids your son and daughter have now gone to uni after getting top grades you know that's not what it means it doesn't mean we need to go specific on one person's life it just means that after our research when we found the kind of person that's most likely to benefit from our product and buy it we know that they're going to share many aspects with others and it's these that we put into our ideal client hence our one reader because there's always going to be one kind of person who may not make up the majority of our customers but who is the most perfect for the product and by imagining that we're just writing to a single person our messages become far more relatable from our perfect prospects point of view and even for those who don't necessarily fall into that category because just by being clear you'll get people on the outside of that perfect sphere start to see the point you're trying to make and go okay I don't perfectly match that but I do want that one thing so it comes down to the core idea of copywriting which is the wider you cast your net the less fish you're going to catch we want to use a sniper not shotgun if we try to appeal to everyone we're not going to convince anyone so instead it's far better to go hard on specific points shared by our ideal clients you know by most of our ideal client that person that type of person that we deemed to be yet this is who we want to focus on because this is who we're most likely to convince and we'll come on to how to do that when we go into research so that is what our one reader is that's what we mean when we say one reader the one idea what it means the single core message of your copy what main benefit are you promising that will satisfy your one reader's most intense conscious desire and why and how is your product able to support the delivery of this benefit and it's quite a mouthful and we'll break it down but why is this important is because the one idea is the crux of your entire sales argument you must be able to explain it in a single sentence so it's undeniably clear to you and consequently will be clear in the copy that you write it focuses the copy and doesn't overwhelm the prospect with competing benefits or features that will dilute the primary benefit most relevant to them so an example of this glucosamine helps support joints of older dogs so they can walk more comfortably our treats contain the highest concentration of naturally sourced glucosamine and that is an example of copy what could be copy but also more often than not the one idea and something like this the writing is just so you understand it in your own head and then you can write copy around it but it's so important that you can boil down the one idea to a sentence like that so by establishing the one idea of your copy you know i.e. what you want to get the reader to believe by the time they finish reading you'll focus your entire argument and ultimately it comes down to a single fact which is the more things you try to convince your reader of the less likely they'll believe you and the less weight each point will hold a fully believed idea is 100 times more powerful than 10 partially believed ideas you can use other subsequent subsequent claims to to support the central idea that you're going for but a huge mistake martis make is blasting prospects with loads of benefits straight away which makes them instantly less believable and gives the reader too much to think about you know other benefits can and should form part of your argument and other points should form part of your argument but everything you write should always revolve around one common theme that will be most likely to convince your ideal client your reader there are plenty of formulas that you can use to come up with your one idea all driven by the research that you do of course and it's important to note we're going to be going into the research in a moment and researchers the key to figure out all of this so if this still isn't entirely clear as you write now don't worry because it will be as we go through it in real time or not real time but you know as we go through the process but yeah it's all driven by research and similarly there are ways to strengthen ideas and to use other messages to support your one idea having your one idea doesn't mean that you can't talk about anything else and you know you can't mention any other benefits it just means that that is the central point that everything else needs to relate back to that and again we're going to talk about a specific is this when what I'm what it means practically speaking when writing copy and deciding what to write about but for now though just remember that you need to establish your one idea to give focus to your sales argument and make it far more likely that your prospect will buy what is the one main thing that you are promising them next the one offer what does it mean the entirety of what your prospect will gain after taking action what deliverables are you promising to your prospect what is the cost to them for getting these deliverables this is important because your offer must be clear otherwise nobody will trust you to deliver on it simply put they must be able to picture exactly what they'll gain and this must be easily defined because they confused mind doesn't buy or click or convert an example of this again this is just making it clear for your yourself and your own head by entering their email my prospect will receive a free PDF that details the seven things I've learned about ppc ads it will be downloadable on the next page and it will be delivered to them via email that's just gain clear on exactly what we're giving to them and it's so important and as you've seen here I've not used a paid example I've not used a product as an example I've used what we would call a lead magnet so something that is free and something that's digital just to show you that any piece of copy of your writing whether it's an email or a landing page or an entire sales page is always going to have a single offer on it you're always going to be asking someone to do one thing that you're promising them one particular thing and you need to frame exactly what that is how they're going to get it and what it's going to cost them whether that be money or whether that be putting in an email the one offer that you have it can be made more desirable through your copyright skills and and how you present it on the page and again this is something that we're going to talk about when we move on to writing copy but you can only ever have one offer because you want it to directly support your one idea you know you're effectively showing your one reader how they can take advantage of your one idea through your one offer you're showing them how they can get that one idea that you've been talking about and that's going to be through your offer so it's the key that's going to allow them to fulfill the desire that's been affirmed by your copy you know that's why it's so important to lay out your offer clearly and to make it as a attractive and as easy as possible for your reader to take you up on so that's why just having one offer and being super clear on what that is is important okay and lastly one action what it means there must only be a single action that you're guiding your reader towards performing for each piece of copy you write this is important because multiple options are one of the biggest conversion killers you must establish in line with your one offer what the single action the single thing should be that you want the readers to take otherwise you run the risk of them getting overwhelmed or sidetracked with something unrelated to your ultimate goal and example of this is on this page I only want the reader to click through to the order form so I won't include any other links or buttons to distract them from that single aim this is closely tied to your one offer but and to be honest I think it could be wrapped into the one offer and I think most people do wrap it into the one offer and they will use either just three points or they'll add something else to fill that forth spot but I include it as it's own part because it's such an important yet simple rule that too many people get wrong you should only have a last good reader to do one thing per page the more opportunities you give them to stray away from your copies one offer the less likely they'll be to continue through your marketing funnel and particularly in agencies I see people link to blog posts just for the sake of it on a page because they can and having things on the side and having little pop ups here and there for no real reason when really you're just trying to get them to convert so you don't want to distract you don't want them to click a link and take into another page and risk closing down the browser you know the more opportunities you give them to stray away from your copies one offer you know the less likely they're going to be to continue but some people despite having the one offer nailed down still ask their readers take two actions like subscribe to a newsletter and then click through to the next page and they're separate on the page although you know the link blog posts or whatever it is that's why I've included in our rule of one one action from your prospect per page and that's it people get decision anxiety easily so there's no need to give them more options and more things to do they need to be shown a single path and again we'll we'll show you we'll show you how this works as we go through but it's quite an easy concept I should also mention at this point there are always exceptions to these rules I know I say the rule of one and generally most of the time you absolutely should stick to the rule of one to reoer but there are always going to be slight exceptions nothing in marketing is ever set and stone ultimately testing is the only right answer if anything that you do in real life contradicts anything I've said but you prove yourself right then you go with that for that audience if that's what works the maths what works but typically you want to stick to the rule of one but when a single piece of copy it hears to all the four rules of reoer it will be far easier for the prospect to understand more persuasive for your ideal client you'll see higher conversion rates and it will make the entire process easier for you as well so it just focuses every aspect of your copy and it makes the rest of the journey far easier to plan and write too so whatever you have to go on to write next after you've written a particular page it means you've already been following a specific way of writing these things and structuring them so then it becomes far easier to write the next piece because you already know what someone has been exposed to and the stages of awareness that we already discussed are going to affect exactly how you present each point of reoer in any piece of copy of course but this is what we'll talk about later on when discussing how to actually write things but quite simply if you have a firm understanding of the stages of awareness and the rule of one or reoer and you remember to apply them in your copywriting you will be automatically more effective than 90% of marketers and copywriters out there I promise you just remembering these two really important bits of theory will give you the expertise that so people lack so many people lack just because they're not sure of where to start or how to how to focus their copywriting the concepts we've been through are pretty much the minimum viable aspects of theory that you need to understand to be a good copywriter and although we'll be moving on to pretty much entirely practical lessons from now on there's still one last piece of the workbench effectively that we need to set up before we can move on to writing the copy and rather excitingly we're going to talk about research so research the foundation of every successful campaign you may often hear the quote that copywriting is 80% or any other kind of percentage that is high research and only 20% writing and again there's a lot of merit in that quote every successful campaign is built on heavy hitting research because without it as I'm sure you'll recognize by what we've been through already without understanding your product and your customer and the market you're writing in you won't be able to sell anything successfully so research is crucial and I want to take you through the multi-million pound process that will win for you time and time again why is it a multi-million pound process because it sounds kind of cool and because it's what I've used to help me make all the sales in the last two years really and it's a bit evolved you know it continues to evolve I suppose but it's at a point now where I haven't changed it hugely for a good kind of year and this is what I have found helps me time and time again so research is the foundation of every successful campaign unfortunately it's also the foundation of many marketing campaigns that fail research is an extremely broad term and many processes that purport to be researched don't always give us what we need to to write when in copy so not only is it vitally important that we conduct research in the first place it's also important that we research in the right way so I'm going to give you the the very same research process that I and my agencies and businesses use that help us craft laser-focused messaging you know messaging that translates into successful copy and successful campaigns I won't say that this is the only way to conduct research and for sure some people use successful methods by doing different things they they they may do it in slightly different ways maybe you're completely different but what I'm about to show you in detail is a way that I know works since this is the exact process I use myself I'm also going to provide you with a step by step guide effectively and try to to be as detailed as I can because I appreciate you can't really ask questions directly now but I will I'll try to be as detailed as I can right now so you can you know just go back through it and refer back to this this section easily I just want to show you what I know works for me okay so research process the sticky research process is what I call it it's not a call it it's not a term I coined it it was probably from both copy hackers shout out to Joanna Weep who was instrumental in in teaching me when I was starting my copy writing career and from my my friend and fellow copy writer and marker Jonathan Jonathan Baldwin Sacha angry if I can butcher his name anymore who I know have both used the term sticky to refer to copy writing and messaging and research before so I think that's where I get the title from but what what is what is mine and how I how my structure is that it's it's split into three very distinct sections product research which is what you've got to work with already what you're trying to sell capacity research which is what others are already doing and market research what your audience really wants I've often considered coming up with sexier names for the research process but I'm trying to keep to the rule of copy writing so I suppose that clarity should come first but for each step I will go in depth and give you the best possible idea of what works and how it works I'm also going to reference tools and websites to make your job easier for you but like I said I'm going to give you a full break down of this anyway since I've taken you through a lot so far and I appreciate the your brains may be a little overloaded although it's still recommend listening to this in its entirety so I can try and cover any questions that you might have okay so the first part of process is product research and likewise this is split into three distinct sections the product, to well obviously the ideal client and the existing brand the product again is split into three sections which is the physical product the facts and features of the product that we've already touched on the functional product which are the benefits of those facts and and USPs so anything that makes the product unique so unique selling proposition or unique selling point what makes it different the second part is the ideal client which is who was the product created for and also who buys it there's a distinction between these two questions and depending on how your the position of your product already you may view it slightly differently and the existing brand lastly which is the image and if that aligns with the ideal client and what authority we can already take from the brand you know what's the status of trust in the market how much proof can you show that the the brand that you're working with is is good the easiest way to think about product research on the whole is to become an expert as big an expert as you can on the product you should know everything about it from the manufacturing process down to all the possible benefits that it could provide someone with then you want to look at what kind of people use it or would recognize it after something they could benefit from and then you want to have a firm understanding of the business presenting the product and how they're already viewed within the market this is the exact set of documents I use for product research and I'm just going to take you through relatively quickly because I feel like product research is the easiest thing to conduct and will come the most naturally to you as you can see on the left we have the first part which is the facts and features the benefits and the USPs with the facts and features you list down everything you possibly can about the product any objective facts or any features that it has that are indisputable that are cold, hard, stone, facts you know them down how long it takes a manufacturer where it's manufactured who it's suitable for what the ingredients are if there's anyone who can't use it when it comes to allergies or whatever features it has obviously so what it actually has on it or in it's the storage size that obviously I'm trying to you may not necessarily have all these things it is a big big big different if you're advertising a speaker versus toy that role but for toy that role how many players it how long is it how long does it take to get delivered all of these things that are facts and features about the product or about the service that you can possibly note down you put it down you should note everything about it and I can't state that enough any facts any features get them down the next column is benefits I'm not going to go through the whole process of how you turn facts and features and benefits because I think that is there's enough on that out there and it's the first thing that any copywriter learns so effectively it's just that fact or feature is there a benefit that it gives to someone can you directly link that fact to what it would mean to someone in real life just as a quick example the touch screen on a phone that's a feature a benefit of that touch screen is that it's easier to navigate between apps for example so trying to use an example used earlier so there there you go that's a clear benefit similarly using another example that we've already seen the fact of the service that provides snacks and products to bars and pubs a fact of that is that someone can add as many items to their basket as they want and then check out the benefit of that is that the person doesn't get locked into any confusing contracts and of course you can refrain benefits depending on the person you're talking to depending on the rest of the research that you come out with but initially if you have any clear benefits you already know the fact or feature provides you know those down and you can note it down next to it you know so it links directly on the sheet and then similarly on the third row USPs if any of those facts features benefits are unique to that product and there's something that no other products on the market have and you already know that then you note that down you say what makes it unique so hopefully that should be clear enough for you you just get as much written down there as you can straight away when you've done the research about the product itself the next section which is the ideal client there are two ways that you can go about working out who your ideal client is the first one is if you if the business you're working with already has an existing audience and it has a you know a fair pool of customers to pool for a more ready look at the people who buy most frequently people who buy repeatedly or people who spend the most get the top kind of 15 profiles of those people whether you have if you have access to the information of course it's always handy if you have access to as much information as possible so on you know their emails and how much they've bought and where they're from where they're located if you can find their Facebook profiles or whatever then that's also another reason or their LinkedIn profiles that's just as good link their profiles in this box I recommend trying to find about 15 people and then go through them and note similarities between them there's no surefire way on how to do this you just need to investigate each person as much as you can and see what they have in common with each other and then you can fill out the net the section that we're going to I'm going to show you in a minute but that's if you already have an existing audience do that because that will give you a good idea of who is already buying it and who you can already clearly appeal to the second option is if you don't have an existing audience and if the business is new or maybe they don't have enough data or you don't have access to the data the next best thing you can do is look at who the product was designed for if you're choosing product option number two for identifying your ideal client then I would recommend conducting competitor and market research before completing this just so you have a better view of everything else but what you want to do in this case is note down the ideal client's gender their age their job and their income their family status their location what social media they use and how often they use it the reason that they need the product the number one reason they need the product and their stage of awareness get that note down again and you should be thinking about who was this product designed for so talk to person who created it why did they create it who did they have a mind when they're creating it and ask them to imagine if it was a person who would they be how would you answer all these questions and then once you've gone through the audience data in option one or once you have gone through all the other research and filled out option two then you need to complete that ideal client profile on the second part of the second page which is after you've done all that research and after you've looked at the other data put down the gender age job and income family status location social media usage reason they need the product as data awareness get that locked in because then you have justifiable reasons for putting those things because either you've been through who the highest buyers are what they seem to have in common generally or you've completely narrowed down who the product was designed for and who it's most likely to appeal to and the rest of the research will enhance this process so please don't think that once you've done this research like the product research that's it and you'll never come back to it you should be adding to it as you do the rest of the research as well because you will always pick up on things that you didn't see before and that goes for advice first for everything else always refer back to research you'll already done and keep a record of everything you're doing so you can go back through and adjust it if need be so that's the ideal client just making sure that you are identifying the one reader that ideal client who you're going to imagine that you're writing to next the existing brand the last section of the product research does the public image of the existing brand align with the ideal client why does it do you find that the people who engage with the brand and the public image it seems to have the reactions it seems to get the general image that it's trying to portray in its advertising could it be trying harder to link to the ideal client that you have identified this is really only for if the brand is already established if you find that the ideal client is someone different to who they're actually trying to appeal to you need to put down weather or not the images doing a good job of of representing and appealing to the ideal client and if it isn't then why isn't it doing it what's different you know if you find that actually the ideal client is is a man and obviously this is in the broadest terms possible but all the branding is trying to appeal to women clearly you need to do something about that so just note that down and you can use that future reference and then lastly what aspects of the business or the individual client could be viewed as a reason to trust in their expertise do they have qualifications do they have X number of sales have they got loads of testimonials note down anything possible about the existing business where you could view it as a reason to trust them and something that's clearly supportive of what they're supporting to be whether that be you know an expert in the space or a product that solves a problem you need to make sure that you have proof for that so note down everything that you possibly can about the existing proof elements of a business and they could be really anything so you know but mainly you want to be looking at qualifications years of experience testimonials sales figures any kind of satisfaction percentages feedback whatever it is stuff like that note it down where you can and that is a very quick rundown of the product research process and we're going to be seeing this kind of inaction and fill out as we as we go through the rest of it so we'll start to make more sense as we look at the rest of the research as well but that is where you want to start like just getting an understanding the product or the service that you are working with all right so the next phase a competitor research competitor research is all about understanding what's already taking place in the market you want to know what kinds of things your audience are being exposed to by by other businesses and this is too folderally you know one it allows you to see things that are already working or not working and two it allows you to keep an eye on your competitors to see if they're missing any opportunities or if they're they're capitalizing continuously on a specific topic or a specific medium the way to do competitor research it's it's really it's quite free flowing the basic concept is to find competitors you know outside of the ones that will already be obvious to you because you'll you'll be easily easily be able to find people who are selling the same kinds of products that they exist but the best way to find competitors and see what your audience are being exposed to by them is to act as your ideal client actors your audience so set up new accounts on Facebook on Google on YouTube and Reddit and dedicate them to that project so on on those accounts you only want to be searching as if you are the ideal client you search terms are similar to the concerns the your ideal client likely has and obviously this will be from the ideal client profile that you have but if you don't have it nailed down just yet you'll just want to search terms around the kind of products and problems that you know that your competitors are solving and probably that you want to solve for your audience as well but search on Google for terms are similar click into the ads eventually these are sharp on Facebook as well join Facebook do as much as you can to act like your ideal client and record what you see as you're going through this is a very free flowing exercise you just want to see what your audience are being exposed to as you go through with this you can make and this is up to you how you do it but you can make specific records of so screenshots and notes of the funnels that you're traversing so what was the ad that got you to click what did it say where did that lead you what did you see when you were there what was the next link that they offered how many things they showing you what kind of emails are they sending how frequently they sending emails what kind of points that they're hitting on you just want to understand usually your top kind of two to three competitors you just want to understand what they're doing and how they're approaches and and this isn't going to be you know all useful straight away but as you go on and you you write for the project and you and you create new things for the project it will be stuff you will constantly go back to and have a look and keep an eye on to see what others have done so don't think that this is just a one and done exercise this is something you want to continuously keep up but ultimately it's allowing you to highlight competitors who sell a similar product or who sell to the same audience that's actually really undiused concept to not only see who is selling things similar to you but also to identify audiences that are selling to the same market or same kind of people because they may well be using language that really hits on the points that that you could be making as well so if your product is say pregnancy clothes for women even though someone like um uh Panppers or I think I don't know if it's called Panppers in in the US whatever the equivalent is you know a diaper and napy's brand even though they're not necessarily selling the same thing as you they may be using a similar kind of language they make they're selling to the same kind of audience because they're selling to new mothers or people who are preparing to be parents so you may want to look at all kind of language they're using just for an example never underestimate the power of looking at businesses that aren't quite competitors but who are selling to the same audience and this is quite a free-flowing exercise compared to research you know there's not really a specific way to do it you just generally want to get an idea of how other businesses are operating in the market and what kinds of messages they are using you can never be certain about how well their ads are performing but a good rule of thumb is that once you've signed up to their lists once you've opted into their ads and maybe you've got lead magnets or you've bought from them the things that you see quite regularly from them so the same kinds of emails or you see ads coming up a lot uh those kind of things work usually you always got to be careful but it's usually a good bet that especially there are bigger business the things they're using a lot of things they're repeating probably are doing quite well so yeah you just want to get a good understanding of your competitors such and as you go throughout the rest of the research process and the writing process you can always link back to your competitors research because it will always be useful here is an example of what I actually use for my competitors research I usually do three competitors but you know if I find there are more that are suitable I have gone up to doing about seven before sometimes I only do one or two if it's a relative of the niche market this how I separate it out I say okay what's the main idea what is the thing they seem to be hitting on they may not be as sophisticated and as focused in their messaging as we will be but I generally want to sum up what they're trying to say what their main message tends to be USB do they have something that makes them unique do they have something that we don't have particularly as well but what do customers get if they go to them but they may not get they're going to else pain focus and desire focus these are these are more um what's the word subjective I suppose and anything else I just have a look at if there seems to be a pain that they keep talking about if they're really trying to appeal to some kind of problem or if they're trying to be more positive and appeal to a desire so something that's more of a positive one rather than a negative one so instead of saying oh I want to get rid of something or I have this problem I need to have more saying oh we give you these good things that you don't currently have rather than getting rid of something it's more of a subjective again kind of it could be drawn into semantic arguments but I just like to have a good idea of if they're saying things that are pain focus or desire focus that I have them down sometimes I don't fill those out because there's nothing obvious that sticks out social media I want to know what social media they have I link it there I do a short kind of not too long but just a short summary of what kinds of things they tends to post and if you're not using it or if you're new and you want to know how to research competitors the Facebook ads library is one of your best friends if you just type in Facebook ads library you'll find the website on Facebook the section on Facebook where you will be able to search any business that has a Facebook page and see what ads they're running in any region as well really useful if an ad in a competitive Facebook ad library has been running for a long time particularly more than three months it's probably performing quite well and you can deconstruct and analyze it and see what kinds of things they're hitting on in the ad and then also I always like to look at praise and complaints they get from reviews feedback and in forums I like to have a look right what are people saying that good about this company what people saying that bad out of this company because those are what we can use when we are writing our own copy and we'll go into in a moment another the last part of this kind of research that we are this research process that we use it's very similar to getting that kind of information and yeah and I should just mention again if anyone wants these documents again just just talked to me again touch and I can send them over but I helpful to think about this this whole research process it's it's it's fluid is a fluid process you know go with the flow of where your research takes you and then take down anything that you feel like might be of note as a minimum try to get down everything that's laid out in the research docs that I show you but don't let it limit you you know go down paths to see where they lead as with everything copywriting we don't want to risk it becoming too mechanical it's helpful to have guidelines and to know rough stages that we need to complete but ultimately nothing is ever set and stone and you should always allow yourself to use instincts you know based on the fundamentals that we've already discussed so yeah that will be the last thing I say on competitor research allow it to be fluid and allow yourself to get lost down rabbit holes when you're researching competitors okay so now we come on to the longest but I would argue the most fun and insightful part of the entire research process which is why I've left until last to to show you mockery search remember your copy should connect your product to your prospects dominating conscious desire this is where we discover what that desire is this is where we discover the stage of awareness um for our ideal clients as well if we if we haven't yet established that this is where we discover the best messages to use in our copy so this is like the star of really nailing down what we're going to talk about when we write our copy um ultimately to write a winning campaign you need to have a deep knowledge of your market of your audience and although outside formulas and looking at other businesses can be helpful everything that you need to succeed in marketing is wrapped up in your product and in your market and here are some tools that I often use to help me with this existing audience data of course if the business you're working with has uh CRM and they have uh uh or uh yeah CRM system um that basically it just means if they've got logs of all their customers up to this point uh and they know more about uh an audience than just what they bought if they've got information about where they're from and what kinds of things they like and how often they buy and their gender and stuff like that then use that they use a use existing audience data but also Facebook groups and the Facebook ad library as we've discussed and read it and relevant subreddit YouTube videos Amazon listings and reviews online forums and other social media uh feedly and quora these are all websites and things that I would highly recommend using for market research this is by no means uh a limited list there can be more that you uh that you touch on and that you use so um yeah and and it would be great if I if I could just throw a bunch of websites in your face and say okay go and do some research but uh but you already know it's not going to be as simple as that because at the end of the day you know what exactly are we looking for when it comes to market research well unsurprisingly the information that gives us the best idea of what will work for our market and our audience comes from the prospects themselves as we've mentioned loads of times this presentation so far it's the prospect and it's how they make decisions and it's the beliefs and the problems and the desires that they already hold it's their emotions that really matter you know it's from those conscious desires that they have and the words they use to express those desires that we're going to find out how we um how we should approach copy this information so stuff that the audience save themselves is what we call voice of customer data the best way to get an idea about what the market wants is by getting the market to tell us what it wants you know it's indisputable that when people see their conscious desires reflected in copy they're more likely to respond positively to it and like we said you know relevance and intrigue are the keys to establishing that connection initially and what better way to establish them than by finding out what's relevant and what intrigues are market you know there's no better source than your potential customers decide on the messaging for a campaign and the messaging for your copy so voice of customer data is invaluable to us as copywriters we just want to know what prospects actually say about what they want what do they want we need to know it from them directly so then do we simply ask the market what it wants well as arguably the father of modern advertising David Oglewe once said the trouble with market research is that people don't think what they feel they don't say what they think and they don't do what they say getting information that you know will resonate with what people actually want is quite tricky it can be valuable to ask people their opinion it can be but the failure rate is disproportionately high for products that purely go off of asking people much like an over alliance on logic though seemingly sensible it can lead to failure you know relying on what people say they want is not necessarily a good thing because people don't always say what they actually want oftentimes they say what they want you to hear or what they think they want is not what they actually want so it's a bit of a problem with just asking people and just going off of that first kind of direct voice of customer data for example if a red bull had listened to their direct market research they would have never even gone to trial the feedback was overwhelmingly bad reviewers said it didn't taste good it left them feeling close and that they could never compete with brands like Coca-Cola considering the price per unit and how small the amounts were but they found their niche and have dominated ever since because they're now multi-billion dollar company so despite the first people who drank red bull and were testing it saying things like I wouldn't drink this piss if you paid me to they are now one of the most successful drinks brands in the world on the opposite end of the spectrum we have a product where the market research was overwhelmingly positive so they test groups and direct questioning gave a team that oh yeah real confidence about the potential of the console which was a a small games console very cheap that ran on a kind of mobile operating system they raised millions dollars in funding only for the product you completely flop so you can argue and it was initially successful but when it actually came to market and they were going off that research they done it was a disaster people just weren't interested the you know the best selling game on the device I believe only sold 7,000 copies and despite all their extensive market research had told them the market just wouldn't buy it it was made all the worse by the dissatisfaction of those who did buy it because when they caught the console they were like this is not what I want and on the screen there's a there's a quote from one of the initial kind of beta reviews from our website which was this is the perfect hybrid of something that's inexpensive and open yet good reviews and people saying what they want initially doesn't always lead to success and a perfect example of ignoring direct market research in practice comes from the dollar shave club their initial research showed that the spoken demand was for raises that lasted longer all were far cheaper that is what they found out to begin with it seems logical and it married up to what people were saying but the founders instead decided to launch a company based on what they thought was actually behind those statements and by doing a little bit deeper into what people actually cared and complained about when not being our seropinion directly what they discovered is that the core issue was that buying raises is inconvenient it's not that people want them to last longer necessarily or they need to be cheaper it's that it's irritating to buy and it's inconvenient to buy raises because you feel like you're spending a lot of money for something that is an necessity and you have to do you have to kind of guess that and remember every two months three months one month depending on how many you buy so remembering to buy raises and having to mess about with a protective casing and things like that they were real pains but they wanted something that people openly admitted to whether out of embarrassment or just a simple oversight it was only by digging into the real why that the dollar shave club could produce a breakthrough product and of course they set up a subscription service where you would just get delivered raises every however many weeks or months and you would pay and they would be bought straight to your door so you no longer had to go out and get them and try and remember and worry about running out so that was really the key to it so what are all these examples and hundreds of others have in common when it comes to market research what is the thread that links so many examples of easy to predict in hindsight campaigns it's that the only kind of research that you can always rely on is indirect and it's this indirect voice of custom and data that we really care about in other words the results of the research for these campaigns and what would have actually worked and what did end up working didn't come from direct questioning in a market research context it wasn't interviewing prospects and talking to them about what they wanted that made these failures or successes what they were or certainly made a failure is what they were actually say it wasn't focus groups or market research you know surveys that constructed these winning conclusions or these or what could have been winning conclusions it was voice of custom and data procured through accidental or cloaked or lateral means to make it simpler the people who revealed the desires that proved to be the ones shared by thousands or millions of others didn't think that they were being probed for opinions they didn't think that they were taking part in market research just in passing they would mention it or someone would say I think this might be actually what is driving people when we look at what they're saying it's not necessarily taking things at face value because when people don't feel like they're being questioned they don't feel the need to change their answers consciously or subconsciously to fit in with what they may view as a social norm its market research comes from indirect means the provides campaigns with winning messages time and time again and sometimes this will line up with direct market research and not saying the direct market research is useless because it can be very helpful but I'm saying that it can't always be relied on the only thing that can be relied on is when it's indirect because people won't change their answers based on the fact that someone is questioning them so therefore the type of data you want to collect is indirect for a customer data and now there are plenty of studies that dive into cognitive dissonance and marketing and social conformity and authority matching all this kind of psychological concepts tests that show how people change their outlawed opinions depending on the context of the situation basically but by far the best proof of this in action is just a simple thought experiment imagine that your partner asks you you know your boyfriend you go for and ask you what your favorite film is and let's just say if I'm going to say that it's grown up too. God knows what it would be but you know you're like what you like I doubt you'd have much trouble telling one of the people that you trust most about your genuine feelings you know I really like grown up too maybe something else that's stupid but I really but you change the context of that say you're in front of the film critiquing panel of the guardian newspaper or of a really you know the New York Times for our American friends who are trying to get an idea of what films different kinds of people enjoy. Maybe you'll be in question by them you'll have a bit of a rethink and suddenly decide that the sure shank redemption is actually your favorite film and you happily tell them so but later on when you're met with a choice to watch one of these two films in private on Netflix with nobody to judge your choice then perhaps despite 75% of people choosing a higher brown film in public the actual watch rates fall to perhaps half or lower if they're given the choice between short and redemption and grown-ups too. We want to tell people what they'll expect to hear because we don't want to risk seeming odd we want to impress we want to conform we want to be on the side of authority ultimately and unfortunately this even goes for when people have insisted that they'll tell the truth whether consciously or subconsciously their brain will always work to put them in the most socially acceptable position that they can be in. So what does this all mean for us? Well in a nutshell we need to source voice of customer data from places where people have no idea that they're being probed for market research and I can tell you from direct experience that this kind of research has been what's led to the success of most of my campaigns it's not been talking to customers directly it's been seeing what they say in places where they don't know they're being asked questions and that's why we use tools that we've discussed like Quora and Reddit and Amazon reviews and Twitter and forums and YouTube video comments. Their places online where our target market feels safe of course you need to identify the right one for your target audience and thankfully we'll for a change I suppose we people get to share their unfiltered opinions on these sites and depending on the ideal client some of these places well like I've said some of these places maybe better than others but in all of these cases when we identify places online where our target market shares their thoughts on areas relating to our product we just want to copy and paste the raw data that they give us. Word for Word you should copy down comments posts direct quotes anything from our target market discussing areas that are relevant to our product and I'll show you exactly how to do this and and how to organize it in a moment but yeah but as I'm sure you guessed by now that the purpose of this is for us to get to know how our prospects think to get to know them intimately and to get to grips with their desires and their concerns and their beliefs but you should use your ideal profile you to ideal client profile to to help you focus your attention you know if you already have enough of an idea of your ideal client if you've established it already then you can use that to your varnish and you can go to places whether he's kind of people hang out but like I mentioned earlier if you haven't been able to construct an ideal client profile yet and you only have an idea of who the product was designed for then you can use this research to inform your decision you know IE what kind of person is having problems with the thing we know our product can solve so you can reverse engineer it from this research as well just by researching the problems that your product can solve and seeing who's reacting to that online and who's asking questions in that area you can reverse engineer an ideal client now when you're recording this raw or eyevolk data it can be tempting to just copy down swathes of comments without really knowing what's useful which is why we establish five main categories that this data fits into and then two more that help clean up the rest and I do this as I'm going along so as I'm copying and pasting comments into this the doc that I use which I'll show you in a moment I I categorize them immediately as I get the data and as I'm copying as I copy it into one of these categories the first one is pains and fears so if there's a comment or a direct quote from a review or a forum or whatever it may be that's talking about a problem that requires a solution or a fear or a pain something that is negative and worries related to those problems then I put that into that section next is objections so these are issues that people have with believing a major solutions like what are what's stopping people from believing things what are they bringing up as reasons to not follow through with purchases or not believe what a video is telling them or reviews or whatever it may be so I put those down in the objection section then there's desires positive associations with the imagined outcome of solving a problem so anything that people are saying that they really want or they can't wait to have or yeah any of anything of that nature is or anything positive that they're kind of imagining and they can't wait to to secure for themselves then firm beliefs firm beliefs are opinions that they hold as absolute fact that they refuse to be violated so for example I mean this is the most infantile example but if you're talking to a Christian audience and you say that God doesn't exist that is a kind of a kind of a kind of going to break any any relationship that they feel they have with you and they don't want to want to buy anything from you so just recording any firm beliefs that people have if there's anything that they hold really did they 100% think is right classic example in the financial space for this is writing to Republicans supporting retirees you don't want to come along and say hey Biden and Hillary are great because you know that that just violates what they already believe in 100% shakeable beliefs opinions that people hold but they would rather want true so things that they're happy to be convinced of otherwise things that they they think are true but they would they would rather have a reason not to believe this can be a difficult category to to define sometimes it doesn't come up too often so don't worry about it if you can't find anything or nothing crops up the fit into that one but I had to make it's own category for it because I did find it coming up fairly regularly and then the last two categories we have are other so anything else that is seemingly useful but doesn't fit into one of the categories above or common words and phrases so any part of the markets for capillary or vernacular that gets used frequently really really useful just to to understand what people are using on what kind of words they respond to as they talk to each other but by knowing the ins and outs of these cascrees in the market you'll be in a best position then that anyone else really to sell to them because you are immersing yourself in the world of the prospect you are pulling the most convincing points straight out of the market's own mouth you're getting the concerns directly from them I just use a simple Google doc to to record this for this stage and it looks a bit messy but I love it because we're getting down the unfiltered thoughts of hundreds of people after all so it should be messy and it can end up looking something like this you can see there on the left but nearly a complete document they can be longer than that they can be about that size they're usually longer than that I don't actually think that is the full document but then I've zoomed in just to show you what kind of stuff is in there I italicize everything that's copied directly from comments online or quotes from videos or whatever and I do normal font for any general thoughts that I'm having while going through the research so if I notice any general patterns I'll just put it down in the document so I remember to kind of make a note of it later on but that again that's not that's not a voice of customer data that is just me thinking oh I'm noticing this a lot but your ivox sheet should be filled with italics it should be filled with direct quotes you know you should let the raw data do the talking at this stage and only note down your thoughts when you notice frequent patterns or similarities so yeah this is um this is what the sheet looks like and this is what the sheet looks like before I've typed anything on it I'd give a little um just a reminder for myself or for anyone using this just say I you know here are places that you can look and you can see the categories all south there as well you know it's not it's not fancy and it's not clever it very much reflects this stage of the process you know we are like I said just immersing ourselves in the market you know in the world of our and we're laying ourselves experience what they care about looking for things that they love that they hey that they believe and they object to so we want it to be as raw as possible because the the best messages are found in the words of your prospects especially when they don't know that you're you're looking for them and here's what it ends up looking like in in a kind of fuller fill away um you know bear in mind that this was copied and pasted from across hundreds of sources so anything that fit into one of the categories and then came from someone within my target market ideally as close to my ideal clients as possible was taken and pasted into this document and I don't record I don't usually record where I get specific quotes from but I will I tend to do a list at the bottom of of links that I've used and again this is um I didn't actually mention it so this is from a real project that I worked on a project where I was writing um copy for a well not just writing copy I was actually building the business as well a dog treat for older dogs to help them with their joint pains and generally helping older dogs have something healthy in their old age which they still enjoyed so that's what this is from this is the research from that project I actually used it earlier as an example when I was talking about the one idea so you can see how that one idea kind of you know where that that started how I came up with that idea was from this research but but anyway we already have now after we've done this a bank of relevant thoughts from our target market directly quoted from them you know this alone this sheet alone is a wealth of information for us there's going to be many phrases and words and messages here that are going to resonate with the target market because it comes directly from there and then people like them's thoughts but this is where we go a little further from here on just to make things easier for us and to begin the steps of turning this raw data um into something that resembles copy and and a winning campaign so it's where we we we change into something like this you know we we grew through this raw data and we translated into easy to digest messages for us to look back on the simplest way through this is in a spreadsheet like this so typically how you want to how you want to approach this is keeping the categories as they are as you've got in the raw data so I'm going to use my mouse to show you so all of this stuff here you know I've got pains and fears objections, desires, firm beliefs, shagal beliefs, other and then commuters and phrases you can do directly into this uh spreadsheet I mirror these categories as the headers as the headers of these columns on the spreadsheet and for each of these I want to translate these quotes into sentiments and to general messages that keep coming up and put them in a kind of nugget size summary of what um of what they are so I go through this and I'd see what is coming up frequently what's coming up frequently the simplest way to explain the process is it's just to say that whatever sentiments you you find coming up most frequently and with the most intensity are the ones that you summarize so here you can see that the first so these are also in order of um kind of frequency slash intensity you have that you have to kind of use a subjective measuring system to uh to rank them you know whatever you see coming up frequently or the most intensely goes at the top and then next and the next and here you can see pain of seeing time catching up with the dog knowing what's inevitable particularly around stiffness and we can take from here the raw data that we got getting stiffer and slower with age um over the past year it's become painfully clear that our dog is getting older um I look at her now and I know what is notable I know it's quite upsetting topic but you know this is this is real copywriting um uh uh coming up time and time again you see it's people singing their dog's gain of and starting to notice things um so that's one of the biggest pains of his behaviour so that was what was coming up most frequently so that's what you put at the top next the fear of seeing the dog suffer and lose their joy in life or pain of recognizing new behaviour's or tendencies but not understanding why or what they are um so that last one again we were seeing things come up like um people worrying about new things or things they'd never notice before happening and immediately linking that to old age um in dogs and we do this for every cat to regain uh I'd encourage you to pause this now and just have a look through some of the quite don't again I don't think this was an extensive list um I could like I needed to fit it on the on the screen and still make it readable um but you can just see the kinds of ivoc data that was coming out and see how i've translated it into ivoc summaries in this spreadsheet so you can get a good just for for what that process uh is like after an hour or two of coming through the raw ivoc data you'll have a series of sentiments um that is to say emotional feelings that your target market have and will recognise if mentioned because it's what they themselves bring up of their own accord you know here you can see we we tend to have about three to five per category um which is relatively typical uh though depending on the topic or size of the market you you could have as many as 10 items come up frequently enough to to record but now we can we can really start to see the basis of the messaging that we're going to use in our copy we can see the messages that are going to allow our audience to see themselves in our copy that's going to be immediately relevant to their conscious desires so everything we've gone through is starting to fall into place uh in fact you may even stumble across new benefits uh that you didn't think of before by doing this research you may realise that that certain features can satisfy what the market wants in ways you haven't even considered that that the that will become evident to you through the ivoc data and i usually use um i usually use this spreadsheet for um what frequently to go back through every stage of um of the campaign especially when i'm entering new parts the campaign as well uh and the reason i use a spreadsheet is that it's just to keep everything organised because i'm typically managing a team of copywriters or working on project multiple projects myself uh so it's easy for me to have multiple tabs up to to keep track of different areas of the campaign anyway so now we know how to translate the raw ivoc data into summaries and now the final stage of the research process is upon us. i've really touched on this first point um but the next thing you need to do is take the ivoc summaries and rank them according to their intensity and frequency it doesn't matter which category they're in view them all as equal and have a look at which ivoc summaries come up the most frequently and in the most intense way of the raw data that you've recorded um there's no set rule for how to do this for how to rank them but but remember that by now you should have a pretty good idea what your audience cares about you should be pretty immersed in the market so some things will be clear winners because you've seen them come up time and time again and they definitely come up the most uh whether that be a problem whether that be a desire whether that be a big objection um whether that be a deeply held belief whatever's coming up the most frequently in relation to the research you've been doing then you want to put that ivoc summary at the top and you want to try to rank the others in as best nor order as you can some may be kind of hard to position in an in a precise way so don't worry too much about getting the order spawn just get the obvious things down first and get the kind of best one placed and any that that come that follow that and you can throw the rest in according to your gut feeling of what you feel like has come up more often but then what important thing is you're being led by the research that you've already done so that's the first thing you want to do is you want to fill in this column here and just rank them rank all of the ones that you can and get them in the best order that you feel reflects how intense and how frequently they are brought up by the the market then what you want to do is you want to match each summary to a corresponding benefit if you can so you want to go back to the benefits list that you did in the product research phase and remember you may have filled in more benefits as you've been doing the rest of the research because you may have thought of more or more may have cropped up order in the capacity to research phase you may have been able to swipe things that they talk about as benefits that you didn't consider so that list may have grown but you want to go back to that list and you want to match those up to any ivox summaries that you have ranked so keep them all in the order that you've ranked them in before you even look to the benefits and then go back to that benefits list and go through them and have a look that if any of the benefits can in any way satisfy one of the summaries so whether they solve them or support them or agree with them if they're in some way related to the ivox summaries that you have brought up note them down you want to find any points of commonality between you need your product and your ivox summaries that is really what this phase is about because as we know copywriting is simply connecting your product to your prospect's conscious desire so when we have that down we can see how the prospect's conscious desires or pains or whatever it may be of the ivox summary can link to the product and what our product can do so there we go we're this is really the practical way of fulfilling the mission of our copy some of the ivox summaries may not have a corresponding benefit and that's okay not every single one needs to don't force it if it isn't there that's fine it's just as important to know what our product can't do as what it can do so we don't expect every single ivox summaries to be satisfied by a benefit that we can think of but once you've ranked and matched each one you'll decide on which one to use as your one idea I hope that that was clear that's kind of the end of my research process and the last thing to discuss really is is how important is research um what we're so far leading up to this point before the writing stage you now know your product better than the manufacturer you have researched your competition and made notes on what they're doing and you can even see where they're going wrong or where they're going right depending on how frequently they're add to coming up you have a huge log of raw opinions from your market that you have ranked you have summarized them and made a note of how frequently and intensely they come up you have linked these talking points in these issues to the possible and potential benefits of your product and how they could satisfy them so even though your copy isn't written yet and they're still a way to go before it's refined into the perfect messaging by simply completing this research process you are better prepared than any other copyrighter to complete your brief you know the market inside out you have a log of their thoughts that show that you actually care about them you're not relying on blind logic or tainted research that's you know been been been tampered with by someone's unconscious you have the resources to make the prospect see themselves in your copy and to be at the forefront of their mind by being relevant or they consider important and all this is only possible through this level of research so granted this probably feels like more than it actually is because I've been talking for a long time about all of it but I promise you that this is the most powerful tool that you can use as a copyrighter is deep meaning for research and it's why every single master copywriter that I have been mentored by or read books from or seen seminars of and even and even experience this myself have said that they spend more time researching than anything else so even if you work to use the strategies and techniques for writing that I'm going to reveal later in this presentation just having this research process in your arsenal will give you a better chance than anyone else impacting a prospect's life through advertising I evoke data is something that few copywriters bother to harness to this extent and it means that they're throwing away simple chances to connect with readers by using their language and highlighting their direct concerns let's learn how to write some damn good copy but before we break into the process there's one thing I want to say and it's really important because I've worked with a lot of juniors over the last couple of years I've been a junior as well you know when I started out and one thing that I want to make clear is that you will come across people who think they know how to write good copy just because they know how to write English and it's really difficult to deal with as a freelancer because like I mentioned earlier sometimes you're trying to you're trying to please two people you're trying to please the client and you're trying to please the the reader the you know the prospect and it can be difficult to to go against what the client that you're working for is saying and what their suggestions are so I'm not I can't really offer advice on how to get around that but one thing I will say is if you're in a position where someone is telling you that there is an absolute way to do something and they have no evidence to back it up and they're not an experienced copywriter and you know they have no real control of of sales copy then please do not take it to heart because I've met a lot of people who will talk about concrete rules in marketing and and it's just not the case as we've discussed already the only indicator of good sales copy is sales like that's it results equal good copy and nothing else so don't let anyone skew your mind or make you think that you need to be doing something a certain way or you absolutely shouldn't do something same goes for this presentation if I tell you something but you find that something contradictory works for you or something contradictory works on a specific campaign then you go with the thing that works for you do not think that what I'm telling you are hard set rules because they're not so that's really important and before we get into this process because you know this is a fairly a fairly detailed process and it's just what I use because it's what I find useful and it's what I've used to write pretty much all of my campaigns I don't want you to think that it's the be all an end of copywriting because it really isn't and there will be potentially structures and processes that are more suited to you and you will develop your own as time goes along so you know you do what works for you and you do what the sales tell you okay right so now about kind of warning is out of the way let's actually learn how to write copy as we've already spoken about we know that the job of copy is to connect out product the thing we're selling to our prospects conscious dominating desire but what does that actually mean and how can we how can we know that we've done that and I think it's important to have a benchmark to aim for because you need something to measure against like I said we don't know if copy works until it's been tested but before we can test it we need to have some kind of indicator of whether we think it will be good or not and the indicator that I use are the five subconscious questions this is a list that I have developed over last couple of years of questions that I believe prospects need to have answers to to take action if a prospect can't confidently answer one of these in their own mind when reading your copy after reading your copy then they're not going to buy from you they're not going to deal with you ask them to do and keep in mind these aren't you know these aren't actually questions that they ask themselves in that they sit down and they consider each one carefully these are just in the subconscious and it's an easy way for us to imagine what we're trying to do and what level we're trying to hit in relation to a prospects opinion on our copy and the five questions are these one how was this relevant to me right now to why shouldn't I categorize this as something I already know three do I understand the benefits I'll stand to gain for do I understand how those benefits will be delivered and five do I trust the person or business talking to me if you have heard of Evoldo Albuquerque he he is a copywriter I he was at Agora I think he's still there but I'm not sure he wrote a book called the 16 word sales letter which I again I'd highly recommend reading in that book he talks through a certain objections that he feels a relatively universal when talking to a prospects in the financial space and I definitely took inspiration from him when I was kind of developing these this isn't something I sat down and worked out one day it was just I started to realize again and again that these were the things I needed to have answered to for my copy to work so just a quick shout to him because that that that book was was fantastic and helping me understand that you know you need to have some kind of benchmark of objections to to satisfy prospects I'm just going to talk you through each one quickly and why this is my list that I use number one how is relevant to me right now we have already discussed this at great great length it probably the most important one I mean they're all pretty much equally important but I give a lot of value to this one because this is the emotional decision this is hitting on emotions that they already feel that the prospect already knows they have the desires the pains of beliefs we've already gone into that how is this relevant to me right now is the first thing anyone needs to know secondly why shouldn't I categorize this as something I already know there is a fine line between acknowledging something that is relevant and boring people with something they already know when we look at that first question how is this relevant here right now and hitting that emotional decision we need to be connecting with something that the prospect wants to know about and they feel as relevant but what that doesn't mean that we should just repeat things that they already know we never want someone to think oh I don't need to read on because I already know about that that's the easiest way to think about it that we don't getting a kind of perfect definition of what I mean you never want someone to start reading your copy or to see it and be able to categorize it as like oh I don't even need to read that because I already know what that's going to be so if someone is reading your copy and they think they know what you're going to say or they think they've heard of what you're talking about before then likely they're not going to read on so you need to show them a reason that there's going to be something new you know they haven't seen before because they're being something new is is really important they need to feel like they're going to get more information that they haven't had before they're not going to get anywhere else so why shouldn't I categorize this as something I already know really important question third do I understand the benefits I'll stand to gain probably the simplest one to understand okay gain their attention is great and being relevant is great but if you can't show them why it's going to be useful for them if you're not promising them something specific if you're not showing them how it's going to how their life is going to improve by taking action then there's no reason for them to take action so that's kind of really I suppose that the backbone of copywriting making sure that what you're telling them to do ask them to do is going to be beneficial for them and we'll go into in a little while you know how we actually translate the research into into copy so we are we are absolutely satisfying that point next do I understand how those benefits will be delivered this is really important because a lot of people get obsessed with that third question do I understand the benefits I'll stand again and that's kind of all they think about and they will they will layer on promises and claims and they'll talk about oh this is why this is the best thing ever something I see overlooked quite often especially by juniors is explaining in a clear way how the prospects are actually going to get those benefits in what way are they going to be delivered do they understand the process the mechanism the the the products function do they understand how it's going to deliver those benefits because it's all well and good saying that going back to you know that the teeth whining kit we saw it's all well and good saying hey you can have the whiter's teeth ever but if you just repeat that and you make no mention of how it does that thing you don't talk about the product itself and the reason that it can whiten your teeth or the you know potentially the chemical process that takes place to to seem like you already know what you're talking about if you're not giving any kind of indication of like hey this is how it actually happens then it doesn't matter if you have the best promises in the world it doesn't matter if they're true people are going to go I don't understand that I'm not going to I know I think I'm okay because it's not been sufficiently explained so never over look the importance of people understanding how things work and then the last question again the easiest one really do I trust the person or business talking to me if you know relationships are a bit on trust and sales are built on relationships and and being relevant so if if someone feels like they can't trust you if you don't have enough authority in the space if they can't see proof of you delivering on these promises then likely they are going to back away in fact I would go so far as to say that that is the biggest killer of conversions after someone has started reading and someone has made that emotional decision it's that lack of trust if they feel like they can't trust you or that the companies are have a good enough reputation or they're not quite sure on the proof that you're presenting then they're again going to err on the side of caution and say well I'm not going to give this person money so the five subconscious questions really important and I think all of those cover the bare minimum of what you need to answer to get someone to do something I'm not saying that that is all you need to do because it isn't and likely you need to do more and you need to answer more specific objections of course but if you can't answer or if the prospect can't answer any one of those then they definitely will not take action you need to make sure that you've checked the box on each one of them so this is more of a err as was a negative checklist than a positive one you need to make sure that you have all of them err for anything to work it's not necessarily an extensive list but it is a list that you need to have as a bare minimum so that's the benchmark that I use as I'm writing my copy and after I've written it as well I always go back to it so as you've written something go through it go through it off you've written it and just check all right and do I think the prospect could confidently answer each of these questions do I get these answers across in the copy in fact I actually have them written down on a post it note and stuck on my screen so I'd recommend doing that now so I you know if you want to use this system then definitely write those down and make sure you're answering them in the copy that you write and now that we have this benchmark we can start to look at the precise plan because as I'm sure you've guessed by this stage and the relatively methodical approach I've taken for most of it err I believe that you do need to start with the plan err not many of us are naturally gifted enough to just start writing and and have it 100% so I'm a firm believer in starting with a plan and the first thing we start with with a plan and making sure we have these these these objectives to hit to keep it all under control is actually something that we have already been through and something I'm going to expand on now in fact I probably should have been clearer that we were going to expand on it when I was talking about it initially which is reoer so we already know about reoer we went through it earlier on one reader one idea one offer one action and like I said at the time this is really a concept that it helps in two ways one it makes sure it keeps your messaging focused and relevant and and workable but also two it keeps everything under control for you so it's not just good for the prospect it's good for you and it makes the process easier so reoer and the rule of one is is is is a really good place to start we've already gone through what reoer is and and why it's important but now we're going to go through again a practical application of what it looks like what what what what what what do we actually need to do for reo what what what what what what what do we write down so we're going to go through that and then we're going to move on to well I suppose what we do what we do with it and how we are how we then apply that to the writing so remember again this is just the this is just the planning the planning stage and after I've gone through each of the points and we've looked at what they look like in the plan I'll share with you what the actual reoer sheet looks like so you can see what it is that we're filling out it's effectively a brief and I think I'm I'm probably at the point now where I don't always use the brief 100% because I kind of just know the process and I can do it as I'm going along but having the brief and having it down on a document is really helpful so again that will be in the in the document's pack that I'd share in the in the discord okay okay so one reoer at this point you will have done the research you either will have had a one reoer in mind already or you will have done the research and found out exactly who is best target or you will have had a hybrid of those and circle back around and have a good idea so how we should actually end up rea looking is something like this you can see on the right the example we're using is and this will be the example we use for all of this reoer planning just to make it simple so the one reaer that we are writing to the person we are imagining we are talking to the type of prospect is a man he's 35 he's a UI designer medium sized marketing agency earning about 35k year he's married he has children who are young, lives in a suburban town in south of England primarily uses LinkedIn and Facebook why do they need to product the product by the way being a software that helps PCs run faster and use up existing space in a more efficient way they need to product because they're sick of having more than five applications running in the background that slow down their computer even though they are vital and they are solution aware which means they are aware of and like we discuss they're aware of products like ours and they know that there are things that solve this problem but they haven't heard of our product yet so that's who we're working with and that is who we have seen are one reaer to be after the research so that's who we're imagining so again you just want to write that down have this reoer document in front of you so you know not necessarily all times but have it easily accessible so you can always go back and see it right this is who I'm talking to because this is the typical person in the audience that's most likely to buy the idea now the idea is the thing that we're trying to get our reader to believe to agree with and then and then believe and that'd be the reason for acting on the idea really you can break down into two parts which is what main benefit will you read a get from taking action and what makes this benefit possible and again this will be on the sheet and I'll show you that at this stage we're not writing copy we're just writing out the one idea so it's clear to you in your head and so you can then write copy around it that's the most important thing is just making sure it's it's clear to you and I've always found two two formulas are quite good for crafting ideas before I go and dive into them I will just say that ideas and big ideas and one ideas they there's a lot of discussion about them in the copywriting community and so don't just take my word for it and what I believe it should be because loads of people have really good opinions and ideas on ideas and what the idea should be and and how it should be created I'm just giving you the way that has been the most beneficial for me so that's how you should understand this not everyone is going to come up with ideas in this way and I would also bear in mind that I'm not always this methodical with the ideas sometimes it does just kind of come naturally as I'm doing the research and I can formulate it in my head as I'm going and as you get more used to it you will be able to do that too but I would definitely recommend starting with this relatively methodical approach for planning it anyway okay so the two easy relative of the easy formula of crafting ideas number one is this opportunity that they've never seen before is the key to the prospects desire and it's only attainable through this product that is taken pretty much straight from the 16 word sales letter that I already mentioned from a vital album cookie I include that because a lot of people find that like a really really useful one definitely pick up his book if you want to see example more examples of how that how that looks the one I probably typically use is quite simple it's just here's the big and relevant benefit and this is why it works so it's just showing what they stand to gain and explaining how it works so they feel like they really understand it and if you take your mind back to the five subconscious questions that is hitting on two of those immediately so we already know it's clear in our head right this is our idea and that's how it's meeting two of those subconscious questions here are some examples of that so this opportunity they've never seen before is the key to the prospect desire and is only attainable through this product and that's the 16 word sales letter very of an idea and taking the product that we spoke about a moment ago this is how it would look again this isn't copy this is just keeping it clear in our own minds grouping applications on a single platter is the key to running up to 10 design apps simultaneously without crashing your PC and it's easiest to do with system x a so this opportunity which is grouping out of clay applications on a single platter because it's not that's not our product that isn't we don't own that necessarily that is just what's facilitating the benefit that is the I like to say that's the opportunity it's facilitating the benefit so other products could do it but we're just saying this is what you need to do to achieve that benefit it's the key to running up to 10 design apps simultaneously without crashing your PC that's the benefit that is the prospect's desire so that is there the Ivox summary the one that we ranked as the highest that is the top one like that's the thing they really care about that's their desire that's their problem whatever it is it feels in that gap the key to the prospect's desire and we're translating that into a benefit there because we're saying you know you'll be able to run up to 10 design apps simultaneously without crashing your PC so a PC so that's the benefit that links in that Ivox summary as well and it's easiest to do with system xa that of course is our product so we're saying there's this opportunity this solution this is the solution to your problem and here's the benefit of doing that and this is matching up to your desire or your problem or whatever it is that you care about most and our product does it so that is one way of coming up with an idea remember that's not copy that's just for us all the way the I typically use is the bottom one which is here's the big and relevant benefit and this is white works triple the speed of load times when running multiple heavy-duty design apps by reading secret hacks from the very people who develop them big and relevant benefit tripling the speed of load times when running multiple heavy duty apps that links in with their biggest problem which if we go back to the one reader you know the reason they need the product they're sick of having to run all these applications uh and it's slowing down a computer we're saying what triple the speed of load times when running multiple ones that's straight away bringing up the benefit that links to that problem or that desire and this is why it works by reading secret hacks from the very people who develop them we are telling them how they're going to learn about it we're going to tell them how to get that in this case um this one idea on the bottom is not directly advertising the product itself it's actually advertising a lead magnet for the product so it's it's advertising a free ebook lit which just goes into um uh reveal what the developers uh think about um like load times and and the kind of secret it's behind load times and how to speed them up and I included that there just so you can see that one idea is not just for selling products they're not just for this assales page they can be for anything it's just to complete and focus a piece of copy no matter where it is so that is hopefully a clear explanation of the one idea and how we can create it so it's clear on our own minds the next part of the reo process is the offer the one offer now in copywriting an offer doesn't mean a discount or a guarantee it can include those things but that isn't what it means it doesn't mean when most people say special offer it's a different meaning the offer is simply in the easiest way possible to explain it is what is the prospect giving me and what are my giving the prospect in other words what are they getting from us for taking the action that I'm asking them to take now this could be buying a product and what they're getting or they're actually buying this could be what do they get once they give you their email what do they get once they click a link it doesn't have to be purchasing something and just means whenever you're asking them to do something what is it that they're getting in return in a sense this seems like it would be the simplest part of reo but I find it's where most copywriters get confused because of because of the confusion around exactly what offer is what it consists of now obviously there's that main there's that core part of it and as you can see at the top of the sheet in front of you is that what main tangible deliverable are you promising the reader that is what that's when most people kind of stop with the offer they just think all right well they're paying me $29 and I am giving them this course or they are giving me $300 and I am giving them off at me I've got to tell you drink guys once I can get out oh that's the Kafka actually not me anyway sorry yeah or they pay $300 and we give them this motorcycle part all right that's what most people kind of think the offer is and that's where it stops but that is the core of the offer what are they actually getting what is the main thing what's the main reason that they are giving you something or of course if they're giving me their email and I am promising to give them a free ebook clip right that would be the main tangible deliverable it's tangible because it is an actual thing it's easy to describe and it's can be broken down the next part is really important because most people stop at that top part this deliverable that we have decided on but we're saying that they're getting we then need to break that down into parts that logically prove how the main benefit will be achieved that my sound like a bit of a confusing sentence so let's just break down what that means we have the deliverable the deliverable let's say that they're buying something is the product that is effectively the core of our offer we are giving them a product that is the deliverable we also have in our research and before this and in our one idea we've linked a benefit to that product there's a reason that someone is buying it it's the functional product what are they what they actually getting from it what is the benefit there's the reason they are buying that main deliverable so what we need to do is we need to break down the deliverable to explain how the benefit will be achieved and again this is going back to one of those subconscious questions which is how will these benefits be delivered do I understand how these benefits will be delivered to me so for example well actually I'm going to show you example in a minute so we'll leave that for a moment but I'm going to show you in the next the next slide an example of all this fill about but that's what we mean it just means we need to break down with deliverable into different parts that will help explain how they're going to get the benefit from it it will come become more of this one example next what guarantee or policy makes us offer irresistible to the prospects this is where we can talk about you know discount so 30 day guarantees or money back or whatever it may be is there anything else that we are lumping in with this product with this offer with this main tangible deliverable is there anything else we're lumping into it to make it more desirable and a fairly usually this does come into you know you get your money back if you if you send it back within 30 days or it could be that there is a percentage of discount whatever it is but is there anything that's making it slightly more attractive to buy and safer to buy or cheaper to buy next are there any bonuses or sub deliverables included if yes list them bonuses or sub deliverables are really you will see these most commonly in in for products they are free modules they are extra video courses they are free pack of documents or whatever it is these are these are things that are included for free or if you are making it as part of a bundle package you can you can list out that okay they just need to add this amount of money and they get this for a cheaper price or whatever but basically these are anything that come with the core offer that tangible deliverable for free what makes it more attractive so do they get a free booklet with it do they get another video series is there anything else that comes with deliverable that's more attractive does a electric toothbrush or an electric toothbrush come with a pack of 10 heads right does the water bottle come with a carrying case is there anything else included to make the offer more attractive that they're getting free so just want to list those down they may not be you don't have to feel pressured to but they're maybe and in a moment we're also just going to discuss offer building as well and how you can try to negotiate that with the client because it's quite a difficult thing to do and then last what is the cost of the prospect of taking your documents offer this is really obvious how much does it cost or what are you asking them to do so is it their email is it 50 pounds is it 1999 you know what do they have to do what is the cost to them now what are they giving up to get this offer and then lastly the one action which will explain not to zone in a moment but it does kind of come into the offer anyway but let's just look at an example of the offer so using the product that we already been talking out one offer what main tangible deliverable are you promising the reader a free trial so again we're not selling them product just yet we are talking about free trial so this is just again giving you an example of how it doesn't not all copywriting has to be about the sale it can be about leading up to the sales well and you can use this method for any part of the process but let's say one offer what main tangible deliverable are we promising the reader a free trial for a software that specializes in optimizing application RAM and power usage I don't actually know what that means but that was what it was try and make sure you know what it means you know obviously you have done more research on the product but yeah a free trial for a software so the free trial is the tangible deliverable like that is what a person is going to be getting in exchange for an action how can we break this deliverable down and to pass that logically prove how the main benefit will be achieved I want to click download gets the software ready in less than five minutes the automatic data clean organizes any free space on a hard drive grouping it together this leaves the software able to move the heavy duty absence of space that is less clogged by our new face data increasing load speeds moving forward the software will continue to optimize space no matter what gets added or downloaded of meaning load speeds will never slow dramatically again and this is where your research and being an expert on the product that you are selling is really going to help because you're going to know the steps that achieve that main benefit that you've already promised so you've figured out what matters to the reader you've linked it to a benefit that your product can give and now you're breaking down how that's going to be delivered to them and this will help us to explain it in our copy so this is a really important step and hopefully as you write for products this will become easier to do but the key is becoming an expert in the product and really going hard on the research and bear in mind we're not necessarily going to mention all of these things in the copy we don't need to it's not like we have to use that as copy remember this is just for us to understand exactly what we're giving and what exactly what the reo of our page of our copy is going to be next what guarantee or policy makes itself a error is this what is the prospect a risk free 30 day trial if they're on press with results they can cancel before their card is charged no questions asked so again there you go we're just saying what do we have anything in place that's a guarantee or can can make them feel safer or can they get a cheaper or anything like that next are there any bonuses or sub deliverables included if you ask list them one a free ebook clip on ensuring individual design apps are running on the best settings for different types of hard drives and 24 seven support so do you see how those things are they get them for free but they just add value to the offer and that's something going to be talking about at a moment and then lastly what is the cost of the prospect for taking you up on this offer entering the credit card info so they can be charged 30 no 99 per month after the initial 30 day trial period so again we know exactly what the cost is to the prospect before we move on from the one offer I want to talk about offer building and exactly what we're trying to do when we talk about offers if you're a copywriter or ever free launcher especially and you're working with a client you may not be able to decide exactly what gets included in the offer it's still just as important to understand what the offer is so you can manipulate the the the the facts into that makes it sound like you like I don't mean manipulate in that sense but you know you can you can move the facts around and frame them the best possible way that links to the links to the reader but offer building is is a skill in itself so I can't really cover all of it right now and especially if you go on to found businesses or launch products of your own you will need to learn how to build offers and I really can't I really can't dive into it because it's again it is really an entire skill unto itself but don't worry too much at this stage if you're a bit confused about how do I make an offer really good but what you can worry about this stage is reframing offers and making sure that they seem as valuable as possible because that is effectively what you're doing in this stage and what you're going to do when you translate this into copy you're making sure that you understand exactly what the offer is so then you can frame it in the best possible way and make the prospect feel like there's tons more added value than just that main tangible deliverable and that's why we've gone into such detail to break it down and to make sure we know what bonuses there are or guarantees or anything like that because it's not just us saying hey here's a free trial for you it's saying hey this is a free trial this is exactly how it's going to work and why it's great we're giving you 30 days and you don't have to commit to any kind of purchase after that and you get this thing for free and you get 247 support what you're doing at which you know usually part of the platinum package or whatever so we just want to get everything down because when it comes to the offer it's about understanding it clearly and getting it across clearly but also seeming like putting across that there's much added value as possible and reframing it in the best possible way to to make it attractive to readers okay next the one action this is the simplest one but it's very often overlooked and I like to include it for juniors because people or and people and businesses and teams because they often get distracted with putting loads of links on our page and not focusing on exactly what the person is doing remember it's one action this is all they're doing what is the one action you're asking the prospect to take to get this offer pretty simple it kind of links into the one offer as well and the cost section so very similar but this is really a an objective view of what they're doing not what not necessarily want to cost but what do they actually need to do on the page so they need to click on the sign up but the open's a pop up where they need to enter their personal and payment information that then is your guiding light that is what you're trying to get the prospect to do nothing else just that so make sure you have that written down and if people start coming in and saying oh let's add this here oh or maybe should we do it this way like oh let's add a blog post here let's add a link so they can get proof or whatever nope it's one action per page that's it all right so here we go here is a summary of what all that looks like and this is the document that I again don't use so much any more I tend to just do this as I'm going along but I always like to have it up so I know what I need to hit on but this is going to be really important for you if you want a brief and something to follow and this is filling out your reoer one reader one idea one offer and one action getting it all down so once we have it filled out and we have all of those parts of it working and just in front of us it becomes so much clearer what we need to do to to to to to to write the copy we suddenly have a ton of benchmarks that we need to hit and it becomes precise we know who we're writing to we know what they care about and how they're going to get it we know exactly how to make the offer clear so there's no confusion and why it's going to be useful when attractive to them and we know exactly what we're trying to get them to do once we have this filled out and remember we're using our research to help us fill the sound because we then know everything this is going to be the holy grail of writing focused copy as a beginner and well into your career because you always want to stay focused so that was the first part of planning our copy was just laying out reoer but before we move on to step two of planning copy there's something we need to talk about it something that's really important and there's a reason that I have put it in this position in the presentation I've already touched on it a little bit but I wanted to to come during the planning phase so you don't kind of you don't muddy your planning around this misconception around this fallacy in fact and it is it's the attention span fallacy it's probably the thing that or one of the things certainly that again in the world of modern copy writing seems to to throw people off the correct path it's a really damaging misconception Tom Tom again I see infographics like this particularly on LinkedIn I kind of hate LinkedIn but anyway I see Tom Tom again I see infographics like this comparing human attention span to a goldfish or measuring it against a clock or something like that and I'm what it's saying is that saying that humans have short attention span then then goldfish or then whatever else you know that we have an attention span now about eight seconds or six seconds or whatever you know that the number can vary and how in recent years it's got an even shorter I'm not here to dispute these claims I again I've had arguments in the past or debates where the semantics of the word attention span or the term attention span have come up and exactly what that means so I'm not even going to try to debate these findings if they are scientific I really don't care it's not the fact in this case that causes the issue it is the perception of these findings that causes issues it's really damaging because people when they see things like this they apply harmful logic to it and what they think is instead of thinking that oh that means that I only have a shorter time to get someone's attention and show how what I'm saying is relevant which I'm more inclined to agree with instead they think that ah I only have a certain amount of time to get all of my points across to someone I only have six seconds to to to to to to make sure that people understand why what I'm saying is great otherwise they're gonna fuck off and I'm not gonna be able to hold them so I need to throw as much as I can into a shorter space as possible this is not the case a shorter attention span should not equal shorter copy I'm not going to go into the big debate between long copy and short copy because I honestly think it's quite ridiculous um of course longer copy is kind of wins out a lot of the time because you're giving more time for someone to be convinced of something but nor does that mean it's automatically better the only rule is you write as much as you need to write to convince your one reader that's it but I need to bring this up because I see plenty of companies and businesses and even freelancers are trying throw as much information as they can into a shorter space as possible because they think it's a countdown they think that oh I only have a few seconds before someone that is not paying attention anymore but this isn't the case why would argue if those studies are to be believed why would argue is that you may have a short amount of time to get someone's attention but that does not put an actual limit on how much attention they are going to give you after that fact so a short attention span should not equal shorter copy regardless don't think because we're living in a more digital age and we have things like TikTok and Instagram captions and limits on Twitter or whatever that we have to be short with what we're saying because we don't we need to be relevant take this add I probably should have talked about this add a bit sooner again this is another genuine ad that I saw on Facebook I've blocked out everything just out of respect because I don't I don't want to directly slag anyone off we can't wait to welcome the UK to our new store we now have more stock than ever before and free delivery on all orders of 30 pound whether it's your first time in the hobby or your season professional we can help and that was the ad this I don't know whether to mention what industry this was in because I feel like you may be able to find it and I don't want to again I don't want to call out a company but let's just say that they were selling something and as the ad implies it's a hobby really more than anything it's a selling to people who have it as a hobby I don't want to get into this specifics of how you should approach that but I will say is that this is a wasted ad I doubt it's but I doubt it was performing very well maybe I was proven wrong but again it hit me it came up my timeline so it clearly wasn't directed at people who are completely who were who knew the company and they just want to throw as much as they can into a short space as possible and it just makes it completely useless it's not hitting on anything it doesn't doesn't make me reach an emotional decision it doesn't talk about any benefits it doesn't make me understand how their store is unique or how it's better than anything else they kind of just chuck benefits at me they just go like oh well the stores new we've got loads of stock we are free delivery and we we help everyone that's basically what they're saying and so clearly it has been thought through in any way you know in any way when it comes to planning it out but also I think that they have subscribed to this philosophy of well we need to be quick and concise with what we're saying therefore we can't go over a certain amount and we should squeeze it all into one paragraph we should be concise but we should be clear clear doesn't necessarily equal short or quick it just means clear it means relevant so if what you're saying is relevant and interesting or useful you can keep a prospect hooked for hours and there are plenty of examples of this marketing doesn't exist in its own world marketing is everywhere and everything it is formed by human psychology as we already discussed so don't think that marketing evolves in a way that is different to the rest of the world because it doesn't it the only way it evolves is with human psychology and human psychology doesn't really evolve techniques evolve of course and contexts evolve but we don't need to worry about a TikTok being a huge influence and saying right well we have to get everything done in seven seconds you know we have to get everything said in this amount of time because that's not the case if it were things like this wouldn't work we wouldn't it's not just in marketing we wouldn't have long films we wouldn't have in tlya series we wouldn't have books book series that were really long we wouldn't have ads like rich chef friends that you can see on the screen that clearly work we wouldn't have long tutorials we wouldn't have huge sales pages at the end of the day of what you're saying is relevant interesting or useful you can keep prospect hooked for hours and here is the proof of that it's not just in the world of marketing it's everywhere as long as you are being relevant then you don't need to worry so much about length that you don't need to worry if you're going over you just need to worry about is this still interesting and relevant to my reader is it showing them something useful that is what you need to understand and importantly there's something else that this misconception around the attention span proves it proves that as copyrightes we are attention managers in fact that is pretty much a synonym of copyrighter we decide what our prospect sees in what order they see it how much information is communicated now now what's cool about advertising a copyrighter hells from or what opinions they hold or what they're trying to do we're all obsessed with getting attention and not putting our audience off what we're saying you know seems kind of logical but this means it's it's our job to to guide them on the path that we know will convince them we don't want to write something that's going to make them lose interest so we need to use the attention that they give us to the best of our abilities although i don't agree that humans only have a set number of seconds before they lose interest in anything i do agree that humans lose interest very quickly so we just need to make sure that we are keeping it up and we are keeping it into the best of our abilities if we don't know what our goal is or who we're writing to or where we're leading them or even what point we're trying to make then we're going to lose the reader but thankfully because of Rioa we already have that tied down so that's why we've done all this research from and planning up to this point because we know that people can only focus effectively on one thing at a time and we know that cramming in and over abundance of benefits and messages and an options dilute the point that we really want to get across and it makes each point far less convincing therefore less likely to keep the prospects attention so that leaves us with one option and it's the option that best i say well it best suits beginners as well definitely it's it's the it's the option that copyright is take anyway but especially if you're beginning i think this is going to keep it simple for you and allow you to understand what you're trying to hit just like the benchmarks with you is already to test our copy against this is another one that you can imagine yourself trying to obtain you need to take prospects down a linear path in your copy because take them down a linear path keeps you in control of what your prospect sees it strengthens your one idea it leads to a more convincing argument and it prevents overwhelm for the prospect so want to take them from a to b to c to d copywriting is it's simply a game of evolving people's beliefs they need to go from one stage to the next we're taking them through those stages of awareness and the best way for us to do this is to make them understand how what we have to offer help them one step at a time and that is why it's so vital that we rank all those research points that we came out with that's why it's important we rank those ivox summaries because we know roughly in what order people care about things that doesn't mean we're going to include all of them and do it in exactly that order but we're going to come on to how we manipulate that to make it as a simple way for us to to write the copy but by writing out those ivox summaries and ranking them we now have a list of things that we know the market cares about the things they want the problems they have the objections they harbour some of which we're now going to incorporate into our copy in a linear fashion to help support that one idea the thing we've already written down in reo the biggest thing that we need to convince them off that will make them take action and by now you'll already know your ideal client stage of awareness the reo that we've listed out and the research points the ivox summaries so you're in a pretty good position you're in the best possible position to plan out what your one reader needs to hear to take action and i keep hammering these points home and it's because that they really are the key differences between average copywriters who just go out on a whim and the ones who win campaign after campaign and if you can nail wies down early and i repeat them enough so they really are ingrained in your mind then you're going to be far better off than anyone else but i do appreciate how much all of this is to take in i do promise you though that once you've been through this process a couple of times it does become second nature and it starts to become less mechanical and more methodical and it flows more naturally and you start to incorporate your own pieces of work into it as well and ways that you like to do things but we've been through so far so had to be this intense and this kind of up front because the lessons it teaches i'll take literally months and years of having full active control over campaigns to learn you know if if you don't have resources like this you're not going to learn this quickly and you're going to need to do testing yourself so hopefully this is a good summary of it all now at this point in proceedings since we're about to run through how to plan the structure of copy many mentors would introduce a formula you can see a few of them here and it's true that formulas can be very helpful and i'm not slagging any of these ones off in fact many of them are very useful in specific contexts however when it comes to planning copy the real truth is there is no one formula for the structure that's going to automatically lead to success and trying to stick to any of them entirely especially the ones that are more specific can actually hinder your chances of of things working out there is no one universal formula that can tell you exactly what order to present your messages in especially considering the number of markets and possible forms that the copy can take but there are obviously formulas that are brilliant for Facebook ads and lift emails and long form sales pages and and load it just everything you can imagine there's always going to be one that's really good for each but none of them can be applicable in every situation and i'm not here to try and teach you that the flavor of the month technique and i don't want to give you one thing and say hey this is absolutely it of course we've used a few acronyms already and a few structures like Rioa but that's just planning and getting you the information that you need when it comes to writing and showing the prospect what they need to see it's difficult to narrow down one specific formula so i'm going to try to teach you the fundamentals that work time and time again and i can be and you know they can be applied in any copy or i can task as well so that's what we're going to try to do but before we come on to the copywriting structure and the general structure that most copywriting follows we are going to look at the next two steps of the planning process or if we're the final two steps of the planning process step two is crafting a messaging hierarchy step one which was a reoa if you think of reoa as something that keeps you on track and keeps you going in the right direction then a messaging hierarchy is the thing that makes sure that you actually move forward it's all about knowing what you need to write so it's the what it's figuring out roughly getting an overview of what kinds of things you need to mention for the reader to take action and it's all about taking them down a linear path from a to b to c to d there's a few things we're going to do that we've already looked at to help with this we're going to use our ivox summaries to lay out we're going to refer to reoa and we're going to refer to the five sub-conscious questions as well and i want to show you what it ends up looking like before i explain exactly what it is this is from a genuine project i worked on and this is not a clinical example this isn't a sure file 100% precise way of what it should look like it won't make a lot of sense to you and that's good because it's mine and it makes sense to me the point i'm trying to make here is that these overviews should just make sense to you so you want to stand what you need to say you're the one who is the expert on your audience and on your product so you are going to use phrases and you are going to mention things that other people won't understand by looking at it you just need to get it clear in your head what you need to hit on at each point of the process and i'm not going to take you through this you know blind by line that you can pause it and have a look if you want but this was for a vsl so it was for a video sales letter and this is just setting out i think it was about 45 minutes long maybe the video so what you're seeing in front of you covered 45 minutes worth of copy effectively you know reading it and these were just hitting out the main sections that i wanted to that i knew i had to to talk about because i don't have the research and i'd laid out my ivox summaries and i knew what the one idea was and i knew how i needed to support that and what kinds of things the audience cared about and what the links were so this was just me visualizing it of saying right i'm going to mention this point and then this bit and then this summary and then i'm going to talk about this and then i'm going to add some proof because of how i went about structuring it and how i understand how i understood to lay it out which i'll take you through now to lay out a messaging hierarchy it's easiest to imagine it as a series of steps and the first one that you should take and this is especially useful if you're a beginner so it keeps it clear on your head of exactly what you need to do use your one idea as the starting point you've done all this research and you've created you've created all these ivox summaries and you now know which one is your one idea the one idea is the thing that is the most relevant and the thing that you need to prove to your prospect that you can deliver on it's that benefit that is relevant to their conscious desire they're paying they're belief whatever it is it's the one thing that you have found comes up the most frequently and the most intensely so it's where you should start i'm not saying that every single copy or i'm campaign has to start there i'm not saying that everything has to start there to be successful because i've seen ones that have come a completely different way however they're slightly more advanced and oftentimes rely on the ability to just test willy nearly and do whatever this is a proven way and it's the most again never guaranteed but i think it's the most guaranteed potter way possible of getting it right starting with your one idea so at this top of your messaging hierarchy which is here you know you can see here i spoke at i said desire and that desire that i was referring to was the one idea i didn't even mention what it was in this case but i'm talking about what's the main desire what's that single desire and i told by empathy as well you know hitting on that relevance and making sure it's obvious to the to the reader that i know what they're talking about or i know they're thinking about so using your one idea as the starting point is crucial and you can see here in these adds and articles and sales pages each start with your emotional decision they hit on the main the big benefit that they're then going to go on to prove and convince the reader that they can get as well so that's what it's doing it's a face of being saying hey i know what your biggest concern worry desire belief is right now i know that it's on your mind and i'm implying that i can somehow fulfill it so starting with your emotional decision that's why at the top you want to have your messaging hierarchy you want to have the one idea that's the number one thing on the rest of these add the the adds that you can see in front of you right now on the rest of them so the stuff you can't see the rest of the copy it all goes into proving that one idea that it starts with it all goes into backing up the emotional decision it all goes into for example on the top left one proving that they have the answer to how never to be tired on the top right to proving that you are going to learn how to not waste money on face-to-face ads you're going to be adds expert basically by the end of this it all goes into proving that one thing they start with because they know that that's the thing the reader cares most about because that's where the research has gone into the messaging hierarchy is an overview so you start with that biggest point at the top and then the rest of it and the rest of it can be a bit tricky and this is where people trip up sometimes they go okay i get that but what am i putting for the rest of the hierarchy? well now that you've presented your one idea you need to prove it and i think that's the simplest way of thinking about how you establish a hierarchy so let's just go for easy steps of what you're actually doing here um i also i just want to i want to preface this by just saying um if you aren't going through this in real time which i know you probably aren't right now uh this may be more difficult to comprehend but once you have conducted the research process and you've got the ibox summaries and you've been through all of it and you've gone through the points up to this place up to this stage everything becomes a lot more natural and it becomes far easier to understand and to comprehend so don't worry right now if you're just watching this for the first time and you're like this seems like a lot i promise you once you're doing it for real it becomes easier and you'll start to understand okay i see how it's all links in because you've immersed yourself in the world of your prospect and you are an expert on the product and on the audience anyway let's go through what effectively how messaging hierarchy is created so you want to call it which basically means just gather all the ibox summaries and their benefits that you've identified in your research that are relevant to your one idea so you have that one of your at the top and then look at all the other ibox summaries you've got and see which ones link to that one idea specifically right hopefully that should seem that should be obvious to you and which ones do link to it and all of this means is um going back to the example that we used early when we were going through ibox summaries seeing um noticing your dog getting older that was i think i believe that was the biggest you know that was the ibox summary that was like right okay that's the one idea then is noticing it and seeing time catch up with the dog that link is quite well into a more specific summary that came up but it still came up frequently of a stiffness or another one which came up i can't remember exactly what they were now but say one was coming up a lot about noticing new behaviours because they are it's all about that they're they're they're seeing time catching up with the dog okay well how does that manifest itself and people keep mentioning how they don't like seeing new behaviours that they don't understand well that's a clear link there so the first thing you want to do is just get any ibox summaries that link into your one idea in a way like that where you feel like they could support them or they're agreeing other in the same kind of a vein uh if you end up with all the ibox summaries that's fine uh you want to try and narrow it down and and really be strict with saying okay is this actually related for example you don't necessarily if you've decided you're one idea you know for a car add that it is completely efficient with its energy and it has the best malper gallum then it's electric and all that and it's you know really efficient and easy to fill up you don't necessarily want to include the night and ibox summary that says something like oh and it goes it's the fastest electric car in the world right because that's not really relevant to what you've found is the biggest relevant ibox summary to your prospect so things like that you want to leave out at least for the time being you just want to get the ones that are related to your one idea after that you want to collect all the objections that you've identified in your research so you're already going to have a cast group objections that are ibox summaries in themselves uh so get all of those um if they are relevant to your one idea and you'll want to read it but also just objections that you have noticed elsewhere as you've been doing research are there more specific objections or general objections that people are going to have for example in the five subconscious questions i don't trust this business is a very real objection so those kinds of objections you need to note down as well okay well we need to make sure that we prove the five subconscious questions too so we need to find somewhere for those to link in and we actually that's actually stage four so i'm jumping ahead of it um but stage three order what you've already collated by their relevance to the previous point so start with the why do and then look at the rest of the ibox summaries that you've got and ask which one is the next most relevant which one relates to the why do and then after that which one relates to the previous point best and i keep in that and keep in that and keep in that and keep in that just do that until you've got them all ordered and they'll be ordered in the the order that your one reader is most likely to need them dealt with you know both the points and the objections remember this isn't final at this stage it's just putting it all together then ask yourself the five subconscious questions and whether your one reader would be able to answer all of them according to your messaging hierarchy so if you manage to achieve satisfying each of those points your messaging hierarchy would the five subconscious questions be satisfied as well ask yourself that if not then you can start to look at the subconscious questions and go okay what kinds of things do i need to touch on to to make sure they are dealt with as well i once you've got that set out and you've got something that looks a little bit like this in some way and it's relevant to you and you understand well it's clear to you you know you understand what you're saying and what you need to hit on then you'll be ready to move on to the next stage step three of the planning before we do i just i do just want to make it clear though you know i promise you that this will be all be easier when you're doing it for real and you're actually been through these steps this presentation is i i do i appreciate might be quite a lot in one go because i'm giving you quite specific steps but once you are doing something and you can refer back to it it's going to feel a lot more natural to you like i already mentioned so don't worry too much if you feel overwhelmed right now anyway step three speedrofting um speedrofting is one of my favorite parts of the process effectively it is a more in-depth version of the messaging hierarchy it it's the same kind of thing it's it's talking about what you say not how you say it whereas but the the the messaging hierarchy is a bit more of an overview and just talking about it's more kind of prospect sent a centric it's more about what kind of points you need to hit on just for them to feel like the the one the one idea is being proved uh where speedrofting is a bit more about what you say in a um i guess i'm gonna slightly more precise say more precise way and i'll show you examples you can see what i mean but it's about what you say not how you say it it's you don't have to it's not the words you're using and and again why i show you an example in a moment hopefully that should be a bit more clearer but speedrofting gives a clear purpose as well to each small section of copy uh and it creates steps for dealing with the points of your messaging hierarchy so it's just a drill down version of it here is an example of a speedroft as you can see similar to a messaging hierarchy in that it's random words for some of it just kind of brought it down in in paragraphs but importantly this is about going slightly deeper and saying what you're going to be doing to achieve those points of the messaging hierarchy book introduction recap big idea open loop on why the core concept is important not statements to qualify prospect cross-ed statement on what the book is with brief expansion again none of those phrases might make sense to you right now but importantly they do make sense to me and as long as it's as long as your speedroft is clear on what you need to do then that's okay this is just bridging the gap between the research and the copy itself i can't give you specific instructions on exactly what you need to write in a spit draft because it really depends on the research you've done and the messaging hierarchy that you've produced knowing what kind of what kind of bits you need to to discuss to satisfy but once you've gone back through your messaging hierarchy and you've you've you've edited it and you have refined it and you have decided yes these are points that I definitely know people will need to have proven to them then you can start going like okay how am I going to prove those points to them what do I actually need to bring up and this is where you start to link the benefits on the ivox summaries together the things that you've already done that list of benefits combine with that list of ivox summaries that you've already produced it's bringing that back up and looking at each benefit and saying okay do any of these prove the ivox summaries do I have any actual proof that proves the ivox summaries um what am I going to do to fulfill this messaging hierarchy what steps why actually is take i i appreciate that's a bit of a vague explanation of exactly what spit drafting is um and it's because it's a very personal thing it's just so you can understand what you need to do when it comes to writing the copy itself here's another example again this isn't even as long it's a slightly shorter in in its lines but I'd recommend just maybe pausing and just seeing what how I do it what kinds of things i write like say this is this is not this doesn't look amazing it's just it's really simple a simple points and it's on you know word and Google docs like i don't even bother doing um doing it in a special uh document or a form or anything i just write it down but the main thing you should notice about these examples is that they they flow freely i just allow myself to write down what i can take from the research and think all right this is why I need to prove from my messaging hierarchy this is probably how i'm going to do it so this is what i'm going to write this is what i'm going to bring up but i'm not necessarily using specific words just yet although sometimes um i will use little quotation marks to say okay i think this line of copy might work so i will put oh if i think a line of copy i just put it down there so i have it for later in case i um in case i want to use it and again here's my other version um pause it have a look at it see what kind of things i do it's just clear steps on what i need to write there's no one way that you should write the line of a spit draft simply tell yourself what you need to do and what message you need to get across like do this by working out what benefits and proof that you can use to satisfy each of the messages in the hierarchy and as long as you understand it as long as you understand what you need to write then it doesn't matter how you do it so when you're creating a spit draft i suggest copying a new version of the hierarchy and typing like directly under each point so you know what kind of i've got somewhere you're trying to satisfy and then under each point you can just write okay this is why you need to do to satisfy it um that's how i like to do it anyway uh or just judge us or just have the hierarchy open so you can see it clearly as your creating the spit draft and and you can create a spit a spit draft like pretty much however you want to i like i say i just use a regular doc but some people i know who i've taught this to and who now use this process um use excel to make it a bit more uh to make it a bit clearer which is fine as long as you can edit it easily and add thoughts and comments and sections and understand it then it is all good so that's actually going to be the end of the planning section really um i know it's a bit of a messy end i really hope that this does make sense uh in in this kind of video context where i can't i can't answer questions and and talk about a specific campaign uh but like i say go through it um using real examples and it should it should come up uh slightly easier to to comprehend for you so onto the main event turning your research and planning into copy and i know some people will be saying they're saying oh thank fuck like this is what i've been waiting for um and to be completely honest with you this is an extremely short section comparatively uh and there's a good reason for that because everything we've done so far all of the research and all of the planning and the preparation and the the hard-line deep diving into messaging and structure is pretty much 80% of the work done uh the fact is doing all of that makes the writing so much easier because unlike most people and most copywriters you can no longer just drawing blanks and and fighting you know firing blindly into um the mess of prospects hoping that something will stick you're not having to stare a blank page and just write out whatever comes to mind you have tons of data and ideas and uh planning points to take from when you write the uh the words and um you know it's uh uh it's it's it's it's in a way it's almost annoying it's almost irritating you think god so it's you know there is nothing special there is no particular talent to someone who writes good copy you know is just research um and yeah i think so i do think the the best copywriters are the best researchers uh and they do the best preparation because um they're the ones who can turn over a project after project after project and they don't get stuck because they have something they can rely on but anyway we will talk about it and we're going to talk about it now um how to write the words so if i was going through all the nuances and techniques of writing copy we would be hit the months uh and as is my aim for this presentation i i i want i don't want overload you with too many different options i want to try and give you one fundamental view of how you can do things uh and this is my one and what i believe is the is the best for juniors to focus on um the best way for me to help you start out uh and to to really improve your copywriting in a quick way is to teach you two techniques that encompass pretty much everything uh and then we're going to go on to cover three areas of the sales message structure so you can you can have a look at um uh you can have a look at the the back drop in which you're going to use these techniques so firstly let's talk about the two techniques we're going to talk about adapting i-voc data and dimensionalization these two techniques are ones that you can always use to fulfill the plans set out by your spit dropped and to improve the ideas from your uh reoer plan so let's go over um something that i'm sure you probably already have a pretty good idea of which is adapting i-voc data now adapting i-voc data pretty much does what it says on the tin uh it's the process of using the best source that you have for what your prospect will want to hear and translating into the copy and of course the best source you have is the words of prospects it's what they say when they don't feel like they're being questioned it's the raw data that we've collected the pages and pages of it remember that a huge um word or google dot stock to them that you will have filled out um or you will go on to fill out that is what we use so for this we're going to need that document with all the raw i-voc data in it we're going to need your sticky research and we're going to need your spit dropped and it's quite a simple process all you need to do is go through your spit dropped go through the raw data beside it and see which samples of the raw data line up with the messaging that you've already decided on so the spit dropped that you've done there will be certain messages that you have put in it and points you've decided on things you said right i need to do this here and you do this here go back through the raw data and match them up and I take them comment on them labelled on however you find best to do it i usually just do it with two word documents and then i list them out underneath the points in the spit draft the raw data and then you can work on translating them so you want to look for any key phrases or metaphors or adjectives or ways of describing something that the i-voc uses that links to this specific messages as you go through your spit dropped you should always think of your job in this instance like we already discussed to join the conversation that's happening in the prospect's head so highlighting pains or desires as they describe them or using words that they often use themselves are easy ways to make the copy resonate and you have that full list and all those those different categories as well that you can easily go back through particularly the common words and phrases that are actually a very useful one more from the knot and let's just have a look an example just one example because all we need for this because like i said you already have all this work done now it's just a matter of making it fit the style that you're writing in and putting into context so here again we have real life examples of i-voc data that i recorded for a gluten-free snack that we sold and i mean i'll just take you through a couple of them so you know i don't want to be a picky food princess and force my friends and family to make big changes for me what meals can i make the satisfied both the tolerant and intolerant how do i go about parties because obviously there's a people who have seal act disease and who can't eat gluten another one i hate you feeling like people have to change their plans because of my diet uh you can tell that one's from the real world because of the poor punctuation and spelling and then the last one and why making my friends change what meal we eat is embarrassing so what we do is we take those because we had a point on us bit draft that said um people are embarrassed people don't like changing plans people feel bad about it uh something along those lines so we went back through the i-voc data and we started okay well what direct quotes match up to that and then we look at the direct quotes and we merged them into copy and that's what we've done beneath those three quotes become forcing friends and family to make last minute menu changes isn't fun now do you see how we're taking the core concepts of each of these quotes and we're making them together and we are making something that is concise but extremely relevant we use the word force and forcing because that was the emphasis was put on that um as if they really feel like it's a horrible thing they have to do friends and family it's not fun it isn't nice so we highlight that this is just a simple example of how you change that raw i-voc data into copy once you have the spit draft to go off of and remember by the point that you have um you have all this prepared already you will have a must yourself in this world so you'll have that kind of natural um indication of of the context that you need to use them in uh and you'll you'll understand it when you have a campaign and when you have a specific objective set out through reo as well so right now and just looking at this in isolation it may seem a bit confusing and a bit like i'd still not entirely sure how to do it but the point is once you it's working on a real campaign or real copywriting task and you have all this stuff prepared and you've been through everything this will feel so natural and it won't feel like you need to struggle to write copy because you have everything you need at your fingertips so this is a simple process but it's one of the many lazy marketers ignore or overlook because they think that they know what their market wants better than the market themselves which of course is never the case so that's how we adapt ivoic data to really work for us and how we transform it into copy now dimensionalization um dimensionalization is perhaps the least understood term even among those who label themselves as direct response copywriters and for all intents and purposes it's about making the copy feel more real uh you know whenever you're pressing on a payin point or presenting a desire or showing a benefit you can use dimensionalization to make it feel more urgent more real more relatable so once you've got the copy written uh either as you're going through or as you review it you can have a look at what you've written and say can i dimensionalize this can i bring it into their world more so on the left we've got an example of a benefit your business won't need as much of your direct attention um so i'm sure cool that sounds good on its own uh but how can we dimensionalize that how can we make it better how can we make it feel more real how can we make it feel more desirable for the audience so what we do uh well i'll tell what we do in a moment but it can become through that dimensionalization you'll no longer be on constant alert for urgent emails during that world deserve vacation which is far more relatable for people and it invokes a faster on the feeling something they used to rather than just being told oh it doesn't need attention you can imagine what that's like for your business not to need attention you can really start to draw on their imagination and pretty much do the imagining for them so that's what it looks like and that's a benefit but we don't we don't just use of a benefits we can use it for pains and problems as well so on the right we can look at um this where we're trying to highlight something negative that they're already experiencing where um they're disappointed in the results of their ads instead of just saying something like that or you know in a slightly different um um uh frame as slightly different way we can dimensionalize it and say that empty feeling you get when your worst fears are confirmed when the CR won't seem to go up no matter how many times you click refresh that is far more evocative than just saying oh disappointed in the results of your ads um again you need to the context well make sense to you if you actually have the task in front of you and you'll work out what sounds right and if it's appropriate but just going through and being able to dimensionalize and look at things will make so much of your copy far stronger and far more effective and I can tell you as someone who needs to check the results of ads that is extremely relatable um and I can still feel the pit in my stomach when things haven't quite gone the way that I want them to so it's far more effective than someone just asking me if I want better as a result of ads or if I'm disappointed um but anyway the point is it immediately brings your messaging into a place where the prospect can imagine it having an impact on their life and easier you make it for them to imagine themselves in the situation the more likely they are to trust you and be convinced by your argument it brings the message out of the the world of the ambiguous and into the dimension of understanding and reference so naturally the more you know about what you're writing to the better thankfully because you've already proven that you can perform the research process at this point this will be a simple task view as well and you've trying to use dimensionalization or wherever a message that you've put forward is is bland or neutral or you feel like it could be colored in a slightly different way so ask yourself if it could be dimensionalized for your one reader so how do we actually dimensionalize what what's a kind of good way to remember how to dimensionalize things um what a simple way to remember it is the the phrase show don't tell what I'm telling something someone what they'll get we're trying to show them what it means to them and what they can have and the actual benefit they get from it um or indeed uh we're trying to show that we completely understand the pain that they're currently experiencing so number one we just want to highlight the benefits or pains that we're focusing on in our messaging so just we just want to get them up so we know what kinds of things we actually need to dimensionalize and then ask yourself so what does this really mean to my reader your business won't need as much your direct attention what does that mean to my reader okay cool it means they won't be giving my enough uh giving much attention to their business but what does that mean what can they do if that's the case you know what can they do they can't do now you're thinking about how is that positive for them or indeed if it's that disappointed the rules are adds okay what does that feel like for them what does that actually mean what's the consequence of being disappointed in their in that's and it's that you get that empty feeling you know you're you're stuck they're clicking refresh hoping and I mean I hope pulled away from you so ask what does it really mean to my reader and in three identify the effect that it is having uh that it will have or is already having on their life and then dramatize it with your words and again you can go back to the the raw data the ivo data to help with the mentalization it's a it's a symbiotic relationship they both feed into each other and will help each other grow and become stronger and when you have all that research in front of you you will be able to see yes this sounds like it's come from a prospect this sounds like it's one of them complaining but also understanding the solution to it so keep in mind these two techniques of translating your research and planning into copy because they are very useful adapting ivo data and dimensionization they are two concepts whereby you can use the massive arsenal of research and planning that you have built up and you you well effectively you can actually use it on the battlefield they're no longer just sat there doing nothing it means that all that hard work you've already done that methodical process that you've been through can be easily and I mean easily transferred into real copy so that's why we don't need to go on about this topic so much and about writing the copy so much because 80% of like is in the research and in the preparation and by having these two concepts understanding them and practicing them you can really go above and beyond to make the research and the planning work for you okay so we've been through the two techniques but what about the sales message structure on which we can use them that really is the backdrop that we need to understand a little while ago we spoke about acronyms and formulas for copywriting and we spoke about how there isn't really one universal one that can explain everything and the more letters they include the more confusing it becomes and the less clear it is and that's definitely the case for if we're looking at copywriting tasks as a whole and that's what we're trying to do here we're trying to look at for the most part what is the link to humans psychology that we can take advantage of in copywriting well if you strip away the letters from 90% of the formula formulas out there what you'll find is they all kind of revolve around this structure hook slash promise fighting objections or objection fighting and CTA called to action that is what the formulas revolve around and there's another way to frame that lead body close that really is what pretty much every single copywriting task every single piece of copy has in common they all have a lead they all have a body to have a close three quite distinct sections that copywriting greets have carved out for us over the years and it's because they're grounded in psychology of emotion first in the hook and the promise post rationalization and fighting objections and making sure that our logic the logic that we use after the emotion is lining up with it so we can fight any objections we may have and then an easy action at the end the CTA for us to do something so it's reaching that emotional decision backing the emotional decision up with facts and then taking an easy action it works very well because it's pretty simple and it's kind of how we're wired to act so you'll find that most things adhere to this basic structure and by diving into the practices strategies and techniques that you know master copywriters over the years have have honed over thousands of split tests we can find universal guidelines for writing any kind of copy that aims to get a prospect to take action and it's variations of these practices and strategies and techniques that have led to hundreds of copywriting formulas and different interpretations of them most of which end up being specific only to the kind of medium that they've been tested with it so you get ones that are very specific to emails, ones that are very specific to Facebook ads whatever the case but ultimately they all kind of come back to this basic structure now that's why we're not attempting to make a clever acronym of our own here you know instead we're just going to take a look at a few of the fundamentals of each part that can be used to write copy in any situation so so let's dive into it so number one the lead the lead or LED if you want to be fancy which is fair enough because I think it is actually really the right way of saying or spilling it the lead is the most important part of your copy why well we've already touched on this many times but I know I'm hammering this home but it's so important because it's where 80% of the selling is done in a piece of copy you know in other words we we already know it's where the emotional decision takes place we've been speaking about that first point of contact that is what the lead is it encompasses the first bit of your copy and therefore your prospects first point of contact and it needs to grab a attention and it needs to keep them reading so the lead is very important it's responsible for herking the reader it's where the emotional decision happens it's your one readers first point of contact so it should be entirely relevant to their strongest conscious desire and it's something of course that you'll have refined as your one idea and there's no definitive length of a lead it could be a single headline it could be 500 words perhaps even longer in some long form sales letters you know it really depends on the medium there is no one kind of length of a lead so don't worry if someone ever says it needs to be this long it just not true and it will change depending on your one readers stage of awareness as well to the length of it and to how you approach it but as long as your lead is helping each of these things to happen then it's a good lead the crucial indicator is whether or not it presents your one idea in a way that makes the reader at the very least want to read on but another crucial element of the lead is a single easily definedable part of it and it's can really be applied to any kind of medium the most important aspect of copywriting really without a doubt is the headline headlines always get read and we spoke about this earlier the rest of the copy rarely does humans are conditioned to read them and to make a judgment on the rest of the piece accordingly because we don't have time to read a whole piece before we decide whether or not it's for us headlines have the hooking power so they need to be studied greatly and I'm sure you've seen plenty of headline formulas like the ones on screen and yes there are some that are generally pretty reliable and there are a few get acronyms that can be good to help judge effectiveness but ultimately we want to know what makes headlines work and how we can get them to work in any circumstance so the stuff you've seen on screen now is not stuff I would necessarily endorse because it doesn't necessarily work there is no one formula for a headline that is 100% guaranteed ultimately there are three things that a headline should do and as long as you're doing them then don't let anyone else tell you that the headline is wrong or needs to be improved or needs to stick to a particular formula so the three things needs to do one grab your one read is attention that's pretty obvious to get them to read the next line because there are could be headlines that get people's attention but may not necessarily want to make to read on so that's really important and three set rather than expectations for what comes next those are the three things you want ideally want your headline to do and there's no set word count either for a headline you know I've seen successful headlines that are two words long and I have seen others that are 20 words long the headline or the headline complex as it's sometimes called is typically counted as any copy the top of a piece that is in some way different from the rest of it so bolder bigger it's meant to be read first and there are plenty of ways to create headlines and while do different variations can work for the same piece of copy so as always testing is the only real way of telling what is best for any piece but the most reliable way to construct a headline is to convert your one idea into one and ensure that it's fulfilling these three objectives but if you really want some kind of formula to back you headline up then I suggest using this simple checking mechanism again this is not a sure fly away to make a headlines successful but it's a pretty damn good indicator of what one is likely to work or to complete those three objectives the four use is your headline useful how does it help the one reader is it urgent how does it encourage them to read on right now is it unique how does it differ from what they've seen for and is it ultra specific how does it prove that the copy has specific details and information that is new and relevant so it's those four use useful urgent unique ultra specific if you can appeal to as many of those as you can while fulfilling those three objectives you're likely to have a good headline you don't need to do all of the four use necessarily but typically the more you have the better chance you have for success so if you're completely stuck and you have no idea what kind of headline to form then you can always turn to four use for inspiration and start okay well let's try make it useful let's try make it urgent let's try make it unique let's try and make it all specific so that's a nice simple way to check it's a benchmark your headline if you like and here are some headlines that have done very well from different eras and different markets a couple may seem kind of click baiti now but we judge them on their results not on our preconceptions of what would or wouldn't convince someone to read on okay did they make sales yes or no that's what's important and the important thing to analyse with any successful copy and these headlines are no exception is the psychological triggers that the words are appealing to and how we could adapt such things for audiences that we're working with so even though the IRS owes you $10,470 may seem a bit click baiti or whatever today and it may seem like I don't like that it's in big red font I don't think that would work that doesn't matter the fact is it did work why did it work what was it doing was it because it was new information that someone hadn't heard before was it because it was braduring in a common enemy of the IRS was it because it was being ultra specific in the number of the dollar amount that it was labeling was it because the subhead mentioned that you could have it within 90 days which is a very specific time frame and one that someone can imagine these are the things we need to think about you can't just look at the words in the font you need to look at what it's appealing to and how we may be able to adapt those appeals to copy in context that we're working in so really useful to study headlines because they are one of the most useful pieces of copy to look out for psychological triggers just because they're how important they are so yeah again have a pause now if you want have a look at them have a see why you think they did they got people's attention basically and got them to read on so as long as you headline grabs our attention and gets them to read the next line and primes our expectations potentially through adapting your one idea or certainly if you're starting out by adapting your one idea then you've got something good now we need to kind of work out the end of the lead the end of the lead comes when the reader has decided that they want to be convinced of what you've said or implied so we know how to craft a good headline and how to check a good headline but the rest of your lead needs to satisfy those expectations and ensure they don't lose interest and it is really for some to make an emotional decision so as long as you think you've done enough to make the reader want to believe what you're telling them then your lead is complete so that's how you need to think about it that is in my opinion where a lead ends and I guess I guess to highlight the point about how important the lead is I've seen ads and sales pages with fantastic leads and very average bodies and and closes convert like crazy but I've never ever seen the opposite I've never seen an ad or a sales page with a bad lead or a bad headline do well even if the rest of it was brilliant and it just goes to show that you have one chance with someone and if you blow that chance they're not going to read on for the sake of it so very important just remember to get the reader to make an emotional decision get them to want to believe what you're saying and they go right I want you to convince me now that's what they should feel at the end of your lead that's when you'll lead ends when someone says I want you to convince me now that's how you need to think about it okay having just said about how the lead is the most important part let's still take a look at how to write fantastic body copy because most copywriters and marketers mess up after the lead even if they've done it well by thinking that piling on benefits and features is the way to make an argument stronger but instead it there's only really serve to scare attention dilute the most powerful message and make any previous or subsequent claims less believable draw a attention to other features and benefits that your product has just cause harms your chances of getting the reader take action and it I think this revelation is one of the hardest to drill out of people because it's a natural human trait to assume that the more information that we give someone the more likely we are to convince them we think to courtroom battles you know debates and arguments with our friends where it doesn't matter where we're pulling out the points and the evidence from as much as we possibly can get to prove that we are right is what's important but a courtroom is very different from someone's living room and the iPhone on which they're looking at your webpage so we can't just think about it like piling on more and more points is beneficial and I've highlighted this point many times over the last few hours or however long it's been because I quite often see people fail to grasp this concept and instead they retreat back to to the alleged safety of piling on potential benefits and it really isn't what we should do you know what we want to do is we want to focus on the one idea and proving it and to help demonstrate it here's kind of one last analogy to to help prove my point let's say that you love learning about history particularly the 1800s and recently you've become interested in the later years of Napoleon's reign that's what's on your mind suddenly you're presented with two books one which covers things that you are genuinely interested about in general which is you know the transformation of the world in the 19th century very interesting but another that delves specifically in to Napoleon's defense of France in 1814 which one are you going to pick? this may seem like an infertile example and it is but this alone is proof that when any topic is top of our mind we have a bias towards trusting sources that talk about it in isolation as opposed to ones that delve into other things as well even if the book on the left does a better job of going into the details about Napoleon's later years it hasn't presented itself as such so we fail to reach an emotional decision in that vein towards it instead we're far more drawn to something on the right that really hits on what we're thinking about effectively the more obvious that you make an effort to prove your idea to the reader the you know the wide air that's been born out of all the research that you've done the more likely you are to convince your prospects and it also has the added bonus of giving them less to focus on which means the whole thing will feel easier for them since they only have deal with one subject at a time and like I say I know I've been through this so many times over the last few hours but it's such a vital concept so you really need to drill it into your brain and let's just reiterate there's nothing wrong with including other messages okay but they must either be linked to and support the one idea or fight against specific objections that the one reader will raise effectively this means that they should either give the prospect more reasons to believe the one idea that you put forward or they should expel any resistance that your prospect will raise naturally you know either objections that they already have you've already researched including the five subconscious questions or ones that come up as a result of reading your copy and we'll go into this in a minute although one thing I do want to bring up quickly is because I do see this sometimes never raise objections that your confident your one reader isn't going to bring up themselves because it's a waste of words and it distract from the main message and potentially gives them something else to think about you know another reason not to buy so never just bring up an objection for the sake of it only bring up an objection if they already have it or if you believe that they're going to bring it up naturally once they have read your copy another way to put body copy another way to think about it is it equals a objection fighting if your one idea is strong enough which absolutely will be because of the research you put into finding it fighting existing objections including ones that form as a result of the one idea is all you need to do because once someone has made that a modal decision in the lead and they decided that you what they want to know what you can do for them all you need to do is fight the objections they have to the promise you've given that's it and what's more there is a formula there is a formula that we can rely on to achieve all this and it's actually a formula that I put an asterisk next to early roll and it's called OCPB objection claim proof benefits again not the cleverest name but I didn't come up with this one so you can't blame me but what it does is far more important because it's something that we can use to combat every single objection that we identify and the the basic framework of it is with the objection you acknowledge the specific doubt or the objection and you can or you can just assume that they're already thinking it and then the claim you answer the objection you make a claim to answer it proof you provide evidence for that claim and then benefit you show them what the claim would mean to them so pretty much like dimensionizing the claim for them and you can see from the two examples below this process can either take paragraphs or it can take a sentence or two it depends on the extremity of the objection and who you're writing to and what the format is it depends on a few different things if you're working to any restrictions but ultimately you're just trying to answer the objection so if you're doing that it doesn't matter how long it takes sometimes an objection may need 5, 6, 7 paragraphs to be dealt with sometimes it just needs two sentences it really depends and you can pause now and and read through the one on the left and you can see where it's bringing up these these different points but and even arguably are harder one to to to break down to see how it's flying OCPV is a shorter one because you know there's not even four sentences there so let's see what it's doing the Ultilam can't even run out of battery it's patented solar grids and emergency crank system mean you'll never have that oh no I forgot to charge it moment ever again what's the objection the objection is being assumed it's also being kind of semi-stated which is that you're never going to run out of battery with this so don't worry you know it's reliable can I rely on this that's the objection you know will this run out of battery so clear of objection there to to follow them through with the purchase and we're saying the Ultilam can't even run out of battery that is a claim we're claiming that it can't run out of battery so we are directly fighting the objection by saying that if we would leave it there someone may say okay but you've not given me any proof as to why that's the case so we give them the proof and proof don't think of proof as something that needs to be a testimonial or a quote or a statistic sometimes it just needs to be the presentation of something of a mechanism that supports a claim you don't need to necessarily even show them of course it's more powerful if you do have a photo but you know you need to show them if you're just acknowledging it and you're saying hey here is the proof by the way we're not just making it up there's this thing we could talk about then you are providing that proof needed for something like this an objection like this um the Ultilam can't even run out of battery it's patented solar grids and emergency crank system mean you'll never have so there you go that's the proof it's patented solar grids and emergency crank system there's the proof that it can never run out of battery so that's the proof for our claim and the benefit well we're dimensionalizing what the claim means to them what benefit do they actually feel from having a lamp that never runs out of battery well it means they'll never have that oh no I forgot to charge it moment ever again because we will know that feeling when whether it be a phone or a speaker or whatever that we haven't charged and we forgot to plug in it's like oh bollocks well it's another 2 hours of my life wasted no not with this or you know if you're out camping or well there's no sockets um with this doesn't matter you'll never have to remember to charge it so you can imagine that stress not being around in your life for this particular product that's a really simple way of OCPB and we do it in two sentences so there you go the one on the left again I won't read through all of it but if you if you do have a look what you'll see is that it's dealing with a far bigger objection and the objection really is around like okay well how does this system even work you know like it is this is this something that is real it's really really digging into I don't know if I believe this at all whereas the ultimate lamp is just talking about something specific and then it goes on to talk about a story and someone in quotes and gives very specific examples of the money that they made and saved so there you can see OCPB BIPB being put into the test in in a more um um a more extreme way and taking longer to get that point across and depending on the topic you're writing about it may well be longer than that or shorter than that or the same so all depends on the level of commitment that you need from someone from the reader but remember you'll simply just defying their emotional decision in the body copy you're you're just flying it by removing the objections that they want you to remove as long as you can provide them with undeniable proof and dimension lies what it means for them you're doing your job as best you can so as long as you're hitting the core components of OCPB in some way it doesn't matter what length it is or what form it takes thinking of sales messages that you write in this way is going to keep the whole process a lot more focused now we move on to the close the last of the three sections we've had the lead we've looked at the body we've looked at all those jobs art and how to do them and how it's look at the close this is all about turning the prospects just to find a emotional decision into action and despite being called the close it could start relatively early on in copy particularly in long form and so it's sales letters really wherever you begin telling the prospect about what they can get to satisfy the feelings they now have that is when you start to do the close it's when you're introducing the product and you're laying out the offer and this section will come after you've dealt with all the objections related to the one idea specifically so related to that main benefit you're creating once you've dealt with those objections then you're moving on to the close and there are two core components of the close you need to lay out the offer in a clear and compelling way and you need to ask for the one action directly and if you do both these things it'll help to make the one idea more achievable in the eyes of the prospect it'll lay out the exact expectations that they should have and it'll create a sense of urgency to encourage a media action so laying out the offer and asking for the action this whole section is about making the reader understand how they can get the things that you've promised them and in what form they'll be delivered and what they need to do to get it so this is effectively the offer in our reo and the action this is what this this section contains the key in the close is going all out and not holding back if someone's got this far in your copy no matter how long your copy is and if they're still on the edge you need to give them an extra push don't be tepid with your request for action many copyrights forget that their job is to secure a yes and to make a sale in a lot of cases so you can only do that while you have their attention and you have their attention right now so you need to give them a good reason to act right this second there are plenty of formulas that copyrights talk about when it comes to closes but these two steps and the three points beneath are the fundamentals and sometimes this can all be done in a single sentence sometimes it takes a few pages it all depends on your one offer and your one reader so let's first of all have a look at laying out the offer in a clear and compelling way. Understanding exactly what the reader will get and what it will cost them is just as important to the prospect as the feelings you invoke and we dive into this in five subconscious questions and we talk about it in the offer section of reo the one offer is effectively the personification of how the one reader can actually achieve the one idea it's the gateway for them to getting all of this stuff that you've been hiking up and that and I'm gonna repeat again because I spoke about any subconscious question section the first thing to understand is that the prospect needs to know how you're going to deliver on those promises so you need to make the offer it's clear as possible so they can immediately understand what to expect and of course you're going to continue to write about it in a compelling way sometimes this is an obvious task because the offer may just be a single like a simple one product one purchase that doesn't need much explaining but for more complex offers that include multiple items or a single product made up of multiple modules or segments the prospect may need a better idea of how it works and what they can expect and you need to remember that it could take pages and it certainly has in many cases in my experience this in itself is dealing with objections as well but it's not necessarily dealing with objections that relate to the one idea they're just dealing with objections raised to how they're going to get those benefits that you've promised if they can see what's included in your offer and they can see that that matches up to how they believe the benefits could be delivered then you're leaving them with very little opposition to doing what you ask so you really want to match up like hey these benefits that you want well this is how you're going to get them I'm making this really clear so you can see that if we had to break down your job when laying out of it it would be like this your job is to increase the perceived value and the certain dev your solution whether it's a 10,000 pound software or free ebook you need to increase the perceived value make it seem as good as possible and the easiest way to do this is to break breakdown the one readers biggest problem into logical chunks and then do the same with whatever it is that you're offering and match them up to one another this is a quite handy technique that I found works quite often and it's probably my the thing I rely on most when I'm laying out offers as long as you're prospect understands how you're proposing to deliver on the one idea then you're offered can follow any formula you want it to and exactly how you're going to present the offer it differs from medium to medium but as long as you're showing your one reader the way to achieve the one idea and what thing if you get it what they need to do to get it then you're all good so here are a couple of wildly different examples of laying out offers on the far left of your screen you can see the full section and then in the middle and the right I've kind of broken up into three so you can see it more easily this was for a sales page for a book and this this is all about the offer this this whole section is about the offer and showing people what they can get and you can see here's how this book will get you there effectively saying this how this book is going to deliver on the benefits on the process we've made and we break it down there's a three steps three steps that we can logically lay out that link to the benefit we promised in this case it's know the difference between a good business and a great business discover the eight areas essential to building the foundation for exponential growth and shift your perspective on common business roadblocks and understand where the court issues really lie so straight away we are breaking it down so the reader can understand okay I get now what's going to be happening for me to achieve this thing I've been promised it's not just a big mash of words it's three very distinct sections that help and then we move on to what we call fascinations and bullets effectively so bullet points bringing up what teasing out what's inside the book and what they're going to get again I'm not going to go into the specific techniques too much because I'm just talking about fundamentals in this presentation but the point is we are now giving them tidbits of information about what lies in the offer itself and what the product consists of and why it's really good and what they can look forward to so we're matching it up to the benefit we're breaking it down logically and we're showing them an inside a look we're making that perceive value feel like it's more we feel like they're getting secrets feel like they're satisfying their thirst and their intrigue now that they've seen these bullets and these fascinations and then the last page on the far right we start to talk about the bonuses they get and the guarantee and we're really hammering home the rest of the offer that we will have broken down in reo so you can see here this is just one example of laying out an offer and this was for a longer form sales page where it does take pages to really break down what we're offering and why it's going to work so there you go that's one that's one thing and I will actually I will only do one technique really quickly because I do quite like this you'll notice that on this longer form page there's an inclusion of a PS at the bottom of the bottom right that helps sum up what the offer is I highly recommend including those not just on long form and pretty much okay has to be long form enough for it to not be like just readable in a tiny section I guess but yeah I recommend including PS's wherever people have to scroll down a few pages or something or a couple of pages um include it at the bottom so when someone scrolls under what on they see a PS which is a summary of the exact offer because people would love to skip down to the bottom of the page so you want to highlight the main benefit there breakdown sections really briefly and just reiterate the best points that you've made and any objection fighting you need to do in a really concise way so it's not necessarily going to convince someone all on its own but the point of that is to make someone go back up and read the rest of it just a quick technique I wasn't really you know trying not to delve into that too much but yeah PS is a really effective uh so definitely try that in in pages that you the you write um okay so that's one example of laying out of it here are a couple of other examples again of offers being laid out but in a completely different way you'll see here the all look at the one left from the beard club with 45 unique trim lengths it's got everything you need to keep your beard in perfect shape or it includes a coolest from charge will three hours of runtime 7,9pm motor great for beard and hair visit be a club at commons say 50% of select kits during our father's day sale whilst whilst whilst wow how can cite as that and how clearly does that lay out what you're getting not just the features and like the physical attributes of the product but also the benefits I'm not saying that it's perfect copywriting but the fact it's saying great for beard and hair it's affirming like you know this is good for both things this year's gonna benefit these things for you it's his effect it's got 7,9pm motor it's got this battery life there's warranty included like this is a bonus so great nice concise way of summing up the offer and then the action at the bomb visit beardclub.com one action very simple say 50% there's an extra a discount for you so there's an extra thing to make you want to buy so brilliant fantastic way of summing up an offer and a juxtaposition to what we just looked at the took ages again all these things are gonna depend on how long you need to take to convince someone of something and how much there is to explain but that's gonna depend on the product you're writing for and then on the right frank current we love frank current he is an absolute sweetheart amazing amazing guy but we look at his ad and again he starts to he also talks about the benefit but towards the bomb you can start to see that he gives a clear clear view of where to go what you need to do and what it is you're getting it's a free ad's class he's explaining he's dimensionized it before you before like why this is gonna be beneficial why it's useful for you and he's saying tune in right now and I'll share all of this for you so go here again really simple slightly different to the one on the left it doesn't go into the specifics of the offer as much necessarily it doesn't it doesn't section them out but it's taking a slightly different approach and it still ends with that one clear action so no one is in any confusion of what to do which brings us on to the simpler task as you've seen in these examples of asking for the one action directly the prospect should know what to expect to in performing action and that expectation should be fulfilled immediately urgency and scarcity in hearts culture actions in most cases but they must be well justified and of course you should only have a drive a reader to one action per page it's an easy rule but something that a lot of copy or I seem to forget particularly no ones and people on teams you know one action remember that make sure your CTA is clear and direct the prospect should be no doubt of what they have to do next and the close is no time to be vague you know this is a time to hit home and really go for it and by now your reader will know what's on offer to them and why they should take you up on it all this left is to show them how to do it make it clear make it obvious make it un-doubtable make it singular okay and like I say that you can use urgency and scarcity but you have to have a reason to use those things you need to be able to justify you can't just necessarily some businesses do work quite well by saying hey two days of left on this offer great those are kind of quantity businesses particularly a lot of e-commerce and says that just run constant discounts but for the most part if you can justify why there's urgency or why there's scarcity you're going to have a far better reaction to it and you're going to get far more people take it seriously and click through as well the more you justify it the more likely it'll work so yeah very useful okay so why have we gone through this rather free flowing structure instead of a really specific form of well because it follows the basic structure of psychological buying decisions which is the emotional decision objection fighting and then taking action it can be wrapped into three sentences or 30 thousand words and it always gives free reign to adapt to each situation this whole presentation like I've said has been about the fundamentals and I'm trying to give you as good a view as possible into how you can use it on anything and lead body clothes is just a good way to try and remember what you're doing if you're ever in doubt there are specific formulas that do work better but in specific circumstances and on specific campaigns but we're here to learn the fundamentals of copywriting and as long as you're following the guidelines that we've set out in each section you'll know the reason behind each of them and what you need to do with any copywriting task before you move on too quickly you'll never going to be stopped on when you actually are aiming for at any stage of your writing and that's why it's so important to learn these kinds of things first you want to know what the purpose is of a section what's what you're trying to do right now and then you can start to use more formulas to enhance that if you want to but for right now just knowing that the fundamentals is hugely important so editing copy as with everything else what I'm going to show you is going to be applicable to all kinds of copy and in fact there are only two editing techniques that I'm going to show you because there are only two that I think you really need to learn in copywriting and we call them the cup method and swopy because you already know how much copywriters love acronyms this is also the order that you should complete them in by the way so you know complete cup the cup method first and then swopy I should also mention that editing is a broad term and you will go back naturally through your copy and back through your research to have a look at if it's right and you will redraft and you'll make line at it so it flows better so this isn't replacing that because that just happens naturally as you go through but these are giving two very specific techniques and methods on how to ensure that you're you're hitting on the right persuasion strategy in your in your copy and to make sure you're really you're really hitting on the right messaging oh you don't see so the cup method the cup method comes from a book called copy logic which again I would really recommend reading it's well yeah to go and read it the the premise of the cup method is that there are three killers of copy of persuasion in copywriting they are confusing copy unbelievable copy and boring copy these two things will stop someone from reading what you've written first of all you need to be able to identify them in what you've written and the best way to do this is to give your draft to a few people that you trust generally they should be in the target market you're writing for if you're too possible but failing that having friends family or colleagues just look over what you've written is fine as well they don't need to offer you advice in anyway it's actually better if they don't offer you advice unless they're experienced copywriting of course but the point of this exercise is simply to ask them to highlight any pieces of your copy that they found confusing unbelievable or boring a simple comment on a Google doc with the words boring confusing or unbelievable suffice and it shouldn't take them longer that it take anyone else to read it normally they don't need to overthink it they simply need to work within those parameters and make sure they're highlighting those three killers the more people you can send it to without annoying them the better at least three is a good target you can even form a kind of buddy group system where your team will help perform this test together with each other but remember they should only give cup notes no advice you're the one who knows the market best at this stage so trust yourself that's why it's best to test the copy with someone already in a target market just to keep it along those lines to keep it in the same stage of awareness as well but I appreciate that's not always possible so when you get the copy back from the you know the three plus people you've given it to look for any section where everyone has found issues so those are the first need to focus on if there are areas where only one person has brought something up then you can still perform the editing method but they're far less vital any any sections where everyone is said this is confusing you need to address straight away so this brings us on to how to actually fix cup copy how do you fix it the first thing to do is ask yourself why they may have highlighted a particular section with one of the words sometimes this will be really obvious and you'll know exactly what you need to change other times you may need to fall back on the the surefire ways to tidy it up and to remove the aspect so in the most simple form this is how you fix each one if it's confusing you cut it out if it's not needed you cut it down if it is needed or you simplify it um really there's no there's no kind of set way of how to do that you just need to do one of those things um if copy is unbelievable either cut it out it's not needed or prove it you need to provide more evidence because clearly there's something that people find not trustworthy about it and it is boring again you've cut it out or cut it down or make it relevant you know with confusing you should simplify it anyway and with boring you should make it relevant anyway just as part of cutting it down but that's really what you need to do does nothing to um genius about this it's just it's quite simple it just gives you an easy editing method to fall back on so confusing unbelievable boring just finding out from people if they view any of your copy as that is the most useful thing and these are some easy ways to a to fix it so um that's why we use it because the cup test stops our bias from getting in the way of healthy editing there may be a passage of copy that you just love for example because you because you know you've worded it but it may just be a real bottleneck for readers who don't understand what you're trying to say so seeing that someone has why uh highlighted it as confusing can be a real eye opener and it stops us from becoming too attached to something that's gonna damage the chance of um of achieving our objective okay and swap it right this is a lost chance editing technique and it allows you to catch any last things that even your cover of you as may have missed uh and like that process it forces you to take a look at your copy from a neutral viewpoint so uh it really makes it forces you to justify everything or worthy you've written uh you can do this yourself or you can do it with a partner and voice each of the answers that you have to own analysis so you can ask what they think but effectively every line of copy everything you've written you first for one ask so what is this line doing any thing for the reader you need to be able to justify that can you justify that this is doing something for the reader that the reader is reading it for a reason sometimes this can be harder than it looks and if you find yourself stumbling and unsure of why you've included it especially if you're doing at the partner then you need to get rid of it because it clearly isn't doing anything it is fluff copy much like dimensionalization that we spoke about you know it's a way for you to justify what the piece of copy actually means to the reader so mask yourself so what you're either going to be able to immediately link it to something directly that the reader cares about in which case well done uh or you'll realize that there's a better way that you can frame the message that you're trying to get across and you may realize you're kind of going around the houses trying to make the point or you may just realize that it's not supporting your copy in any way and to cut it out because it's fluff so ask yourself so what for every line and message and see if you can give a good enough reason for its existence then you have to say prove it and this will apply to many lines in your copy even if you can justify their existence by asking so what if it's something that needs to be proven you also need to make sure that um that what you're saying is backed up by some kind of proof even logically or through a testimonial or data you know does it get proven at any point especially almost immediately after it gets said uh have I given the reader a reason to believe me on this if you have and there's clear proof then okay great if you haven't then ask yourself why not if you can give solid evidence then do it if you can then you need to think about cutting it out because really you may be effectively lying to someone you may not know why you're saying something hopefully most of this will be caught out by the cup test but it never hurts to double check and to go through it on your own or with a partner and I just want to give again I think it's a second time I've mentioned during what I've been doing this but want to give credit to Joanna Weeb specifically for um the editing methods because I picked it up from her a couple of years ago and it has stuck I think this has been the thing that has stuck with me the most from like my first ever kind of foray into what I would describe as direct response copywriting uh so thank you copy hackers because this has been uh invaluable for me and also check them out check out copy hackers because they have loads of free content on the website so so definitely worth it okay so uh this is a topic that I felt duty bound to include just because of how many conversations I've had with in-house marketing teams who have to follow a style guide so I usually really include this for the sake of teams that I give this presentation to but it's also useful for freelances um because I do have conversations with juniors about how important punctuation is and stuff like that so I just want to give you a perspective on this on this subject and what I have seen work over the last few years and what I think is important so the first thing to say is that there is there there's not there is no one perfect style guide that encompasses everything and as we've learned over the last few hours good copy depends on the context of the market and its position it's exactly the same for tone and the accuracy of grammar and punctuation it depends on the audience you may hear others tell you that there are kind of cardinal rules when it comes to grammar and punctuation but the truth is that most of the time these rules are skewed by bias um I love the Oxford comma for example I'm a big fan however you know even though I would defend it to my death I do recognize that it is a bias I have and you know not that it really matters in the world of copyrighting at all but if there's even a percentage either way it may be worse than using no Oxford comma at all anyway um see a bias is do exist if you already have a style guide which I know you won't probably if you're watching this and you're a freelance so but if you do work in a team and you already have a style guide that a client or a company insist that you use then fine you know use that but if you really want to squeeze as much effectiveness out of your copies possible there's only one thing that you need to remember if your ideal client knows what you mean and doesn't view you as any less credible then write however the hell you want to pass it first and foremost remember that this rule trumps all others I know how much copyright is love lists and quickfire tips so here are a few things I have picked up that seem to have a positive impact over the course of my career especially when writing to you know kind of like regular customers in a beta beta c or or more casual beta b space so take this all with a grain of salt but I know people like to I do get questions saying oh what kind of things do you do and and how do you like to write so these are just a this is just a list of things that I tend to use and I tend to have noticed over the last couple of years but by no means at the set stone or even necessarily helpful so ellipses three dots they build momentum and they tap into a prospect's natural curiosity I love them I use them loads you should capitalize to emphasize not to be grammatically correct although you know there's no reason not to be grammatically correct basically be correctly correct unless there's a reason is what I'm saying but yeah capsized emphasise as well don't be afraid of that avoid commerce were possible because people don't know how to use them it's fine it I found it's better to just kind of use them so it fits in with speech rather than um grammatic accuracy I love how I just said grammatic which I don't think is a word grammatical anyway yes so avoid commerce the rule above so about commerce goes double for sub clauses in sentences because people just don't get it and they get confused use simple sentences instead and it's true that the length of copy shouldn't matter however make your copy look short at a glance okay because people don't that people aren't excited by the prospect of reading a lot they will but they're not excited by it so try to avoid more than three to five lines per paragraph and make it seem like it isn't much to read in as best away you can read copy out loud to check it it should read like someone could speak it very important please make sure you read your copy out loud it really does catch out a lot of mistakes especially when it comes to line edits use contractions unless you're trying to emphasize something so you know your versus you are it's just it's far more natural to say your um absolutely start sentences with conjunctions if it sounds right so because an end on but you can use those other start of sentences despite what your English teacher told you because it just sounds more natural because everyone I think I have probably started 40% of the sentences in this presentation with the word and so do not worry about it avoid humour um this isn't about grammar or punctuation but humour is one of those things that can work really well and can be effective but generally it's it's safer to avoid it and to instead just go for clarity and relevance don't try to be funny don't try to make cultural references because it can backfire and it can be confusing and I have edited many many pieces of work from juniors who have tried to make jokes or puns or something and I've just said this is just confusing me because I have to do I have to think and have to do work to try and understand it so try to avoid humour if you can because it's safer and then this is this last one it's just something I want to do because it annoys me it's you know A or Anne comes down to the next sound not the next letter so if you have an abbreviation um if you're using H the letter H and it's part of an abbreviation an acronym for something I should say um like HBO then you say um this is an HBO production not A HBO production because it doesn't sound good and it's how we read how we speak but that is an extreme bias of me so let's just me trying to get my pet even addictive rules and biases put on the world so you can ignore that one anyway okay so I hope you can forgive that slight neuroses there um we're now in the final stretch of of of this presentation and I really I really hope you've enjoyed it it's been fun to film I appreciate that this is pretty much just been me rambling for hours on end it's been it's been weird to do this without a live audience and without the feedback sessions and and cutting out some sections that go into teams but it's been really fun to do and and I'm glad I'm glad I could find the time to do it so uh one last thing really which is split testing AB testing why am I bringing this up um I'm bringing this up because I I've seen a lot in the copyright collective people ask about split testing AB testing what to test and how to test it I'm going to share a short here who introduced me to a phrase which has been invaluable for me as I've gained control of marketing campaigns and had to test things test screams not whispers make sure that what you're testing is extremely noticeable on the page not tiny tweaks here and there because this is the only real way to judge the effectiveness of copy and of sections and aspects of the page is to do a split test and you want to make sure that you're split testing something that is noticeable to be split tested so the best things too split tests are things like the idea that you that you go with your one idea you know what what are you going to use um the headline and the lead the page structure the hero section which is the top section on the page how that's laid out and what you include there any forms whether you do it over one page or two pages anything whether transactions are involved test those and change the pages and see see if there are any differences and how the offer is laid out as well these kinds of things that are typically the best to um to split test so I just wanted to add this slide in because I have noticed uh quite a few people recently either talking about it or messaging me and asking um about testing different like emails and and and fire mail, chin, but whatever or different pages and having a look at the results of Google Analytics so test screams not whispers don't waste time on just you know um testing slightly different wording of something or uh a different font for example unless you have shit ton of money in a shit ton of time um but generally you want to in uh test things that are there are screams not whispers okay um we're kind of coming out of the uh well we've come out really the the the the the the practical lessons of copyrighting out I just want to talk about the wider marketing strategy for a moment because copy is the lifeblood of any campaign but there are other things that you need to consider copy is great and it's amazing and it can have a huge impact on campaigns and it I would argue it is the most um uh the thing that has the biggest impact on marketing campaigns but it doesn't exist in isolation it exists within context and it has to work with different aspects of marketing strategies so other things to think about outside the words you use themselves and the messages you get across are questions like what form will a copy take will the prospect be ready to hear it I mean that kind of goes into message matching in the stage of awareness as well um is the product good enough I have I have not written for many products that I haven't believed in and I now only write for products I actually like or services that I think are good um but I can tell you from experience it's far easier to write for products that are genuinely than to make up things about products services courses whatever's that are shite um so that's a really important for me and you need to consider as well is the product actually good enough sometimes copy can't save it well I'm telling you copy cannot save a bad product it's as simple as that so make sure the copy is is good enough and is is there's a desire for it in the in the space in the market does the offer justify a purchase um is the product being presented in a good enough way in the offer are they getting enough is the price too much these are all things that you need to think about when you compare it to what else is in the market is it too similar is it too different to other things brings on to the next point is the product different enough either in reality or by perception to competitors you need to make sure that the product is unique because if it isn't um I mean I have seen and I have run campaigns where the product has been exactly the same and in fact come from the exact same supplier of someone else but the copy has been different and it's been wildly successful and it's good that's a good feeling but they're harder to write for it's far easier if you have a good product that is also unique because you can draw on real aspects of the product so is it different enough from what else is out there for you to write good copy about it is the prospects attention being managed in a linear way this brings us back to the copy and something we've already been through but it's just uh one of the last points I wanted to bring up but you know that's always something you can ask yourself are you throwing too much at them or are you making it simple and easy for them to understand because you never want to make them do work you never want to make them feel like they're having to read it you want to make it feel like they're actually on a journey of discovery and they feel good about learning what you are what you're telling them and then lastly does Rioa apply to the entire task as a copy writer you may only have control over the copy you may not have control over the strategy over the design over the UI so you need to it's difficult I say you need to it's not always possible but if you can you need to make sure that Rioa is applying to the entire task and that the whole team is on board with it that's why when I usually give this presentation I'm giving it to marketing teams or to people who have who have joined a team that I'm on or come into my agency I make sure that we're all on the same page with all this and it's really important that everyone understands that we're working towards the same objective and you need to accept that sometimes you're going to be working with people or an environment where that just won't be the case and you will feel like things are detriment to you and others are almost working against you so wherever possible work and again I know it's not always possible because believe me I've been there work with people who do subscribe to the same concepts as you and understand the importance of the rule of one and focus and managing attention because it's really really important. Back to copy writing for a moment perhaps more practical practical explanation how can you improve your copy writing long term you know we've been through the process I use how can you improve your own copy writing how can you how can you enhance what you've already learned and how can you go beyond what you've learned and learn how to to write in a manner that flows and in a tone that fits the campaign that you're working on well there's a few things you can do and this is really a daily practice that I recommend for the juniors or some juniors that I have mentored in the past and worked with and fortunately now I tend to work with teams who with copy writers who aren't as dedicated so you know I can't already ask them to do these things but it's what I suggest. I spend 30 minutes hand copying so writing out by hand good copy a day. Find copy that works and every day the 30 minutes copy it out by hand start with that you know pick a sales page or a sales letter or an email or headlines or whatever it is that you want to develop anything is better than nothing and spend 30 minutes day copying out by hand just copy out by hand that's it just spend 30 minutes day doing that it trust me it becomes relaxing it's actually quite a quite a nice task but for one it is naturally going to help you pick up on patterns the good copy writers use sometimes you may be copying things from a different era or from a different market that won't work in what you do and that's fine but it will help it will help expose you to more ways of writing that you may not have considered and it may spark inspiration for a campaign that you're working on. Then spend 30 minutes analyzing and annotating good copy. I don't know if you've guessed yet but that first one of that second one do bleed in quite nicely the copy that you have written out by hand analyze it go back through and annotate it I just go through it I use a red pen to mark it up and I say what do I think is happening here. I analyze it and I write down hey I think that the writer is appealing to the uniqueness of the product I mean I'm just going to fucking show you an example but yeah I talk about what techniques I recognize and what psychological triggers I think they're appealing to where I feel like the emotional decision has come in why the lead works what proof they're using how they're showing weaknesses of the product and they're reframing them in a good way whatever the case may be but just analyze good copy analyze what you've written down by hand and then spend 30 minutes a day reading a copy writing development book off top of my head I personally always recommend scientific advertising for anything else because I think that as a phenomenal book to start your career on it really grounds you in the principles of advertising and what you should be valuing break through advertising of course very good alchemy by Rory Sutherland I think one of the best marketing books ever written probably my favorite I would highly recommend reading it but there are tons like I mean I've already mentioned a couple in this presentation of well the 16 word sales letter copy logic there are an endless amount of books that you can read so those are three things I suggest doing that take 30 minutes each on top of that daily consumption of news and articles for wildly different media companies if you're working on a specific campaign that where the audience is in a specific kind of demographic who read a particular kind of paper or magazine or or news website then read that a lot because that's relevant to you but just generally I think it's a good idea to read quite broadly and to get an idea of what kinds of things people get exposed to on a regular basis then a weekly review of direct response fundamentals notes so the notes you've taken potentially knows that you've taken from this presentation and ones that you've got from reading other things and looking at resources review those every week at least once a week review them revise them make sure you know what they are keep them in your mind burn them into your brain next collect and read maximum regularly any kind of sayings or suggestions uh maxims as I say that copy writing great give to you write them down and read read them that is a piece of advice directly from Gary Bens of anger so I hold it dear in my heart and I I adhere to it I do it as much as I can again it's a weekly thing for me usually a daily thing I'm always reading quotes and just trying to see ideas into my brain and review them and match them up to what I learn in the world of advertising and lastly stay curious and stay empathetic those are the two most important things that you can do always be curious about things as a copywriter you need to be don't just reject something at how right never just say oh I'm not investing in anymore or no I completely disagree with you read into it we are I don't know if anyone will remember this from I'll copy writing but we had a I can't when we did a panel we had some people completely blasted for doing that and assuming it was the start of a funnel and saying no don't don't don't watch that you know I wouldn't don't like go on there don't go along to there because they're just going to try and sell you something anyone who said that for the most part I imagine is not going to be a very good copywriter purely because if you want a big good copywriter and someone is selling you something and you're suspecting that someone's going to sell you something you fucking go along and see what kind of techniques they use see what strategies they're employing to sell you something like I don't I can't comprehend why you wouldn't just go along or check it out to see what people are doing so please be curious about things don't throw money away and don't you know don't let twat convince you to to spend thousands on a course because you don't really need it but be curious about things and sign in sign up to funnels give your email away to lead magnets see what companies send you and see what webinars you get onto and have a look and see if you can analyse what's going on you need to be curious about these things because you will pick up so much more by just having an open mind and allow yourself into these funnels to immerse yourself in them and then say right I'm going to have a look at what's going on here so please stay curious because it is honestly the fastest way to grow and also just stay curious about facts out there in the world and things you learn and conversations that people are having don't just reject something see where it goes do some research and come up with your own opinions yeah okay I went on a bit much there I'm anyway but yeah and stay empathetic try to practice empathy try to see other points of view really work hard to to understand other people and to see how they feel because it is it is the you know the key to copyrighting is to to learn how other people react to things and and try and understand how they feel so you can meet them at that point and you can join the conversation happening in their head so staying curious and staying empathetic really important thank you for watching up to this point I'm not going to go I'm not going to read all these again right now because I think I make it myself just you know take a screen draw a pause screen read through them again have a look at what they say and take them to heart because if nothing else this is the the lessons that one person has learned over three years in the copyrighting industry
