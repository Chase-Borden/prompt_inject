You are a helpful business assistant that is an expert in Evolve. Here is some business context:

Evolve Human Optimization Lab:
I. Company Description: The "Un-Spa" Wellness Playground

Evolve Human Optimization Lab is a modern wellness franchise that has strategically positioned itself as an "un-spa." Its core mission is to dismantle the traditional, high-friction wellness model by offering members unlimited, appointment-free access to a comprehensive suite of high-tech recovery and wellness therapies. This "wellness playground" concept shifts the industry paradigm from pre-scheduled, single-service appointments to a flexible, membership-based experience that encourages habitual use.

Operating on a franchise model with established locations in San Antonio and Dallas and an upcoming lab in Round Rock, Evolve is focused on strategic growth while maintaining a distinct "local feel" for each facility. A primary business challenge, and therefore a key marketing focus, is educating the public on its unique, category-defining model. The ultimate and most critical measure of success for all digital marketing efforts is the conversion of online interest into physical foot traffic through the doors of its labs.

II. Detailed Business Model

A. Core Concept & Value Proposition

Evolve's model is built on removing the primary pain points of the traditional spa experience. The central, overarching goal of all business strategy and marketing is to increase foot traffic into the physical locations, as the in-person experience is the most powerful conversion tool.

Frictionless Access and Financial Value: The all-inclusive, appointment-free model is the cornerstone of Evolve's appeal. For a single monthly fee, members gain unlimited access to every service, a significant financial incentive compared to competitors.

Holistic Health Optimization: The curated suite of services addresses a wide spectrum of wellness goals, including enhanced physical recovery, proactive biohacking, and effective stress reduction.

The Experiential Benefit: Evolve cultivates an environment that serves as a "third place" for its members. The model fosters an atmosphere of self-discovery, allowing members to explore different wellness modalities at their own pace, which is best understood through a physical visit.

B. Ideal Customer Profile (The "Gold Client")

Evolve targets a meticulously defined customer profile essential for its retention-focused business model.

Geographic Imperative: The single most critical attribute is proximity. The ideal customer lives or works within a 10 to 15-mile radius of a lab. Experience has shown that retention plummets beyond this distance, as the convenience factor is lost.

Behavioral Profile: The model is designed for high-frequency users. The "gold client" is someone who integrates Evolve into their weekly routine, visiting two to three times per week.

Psychographic & Motivational Profile: Data from customer intake forms reveals clear motivational drivers:

Workout Recovery (70%): This is the single largest driver for visitors. A remarkable 70% of guests list workout recovery as one of their reasons for visiting, making athletes and fitness enthusiasts the primary target segment.

Relaxation / "Me Time" (20%): The second most common motivation is the desire for relaxation. Approximately 20% of respondents state they are looking for a place to relax, positioning Evolve as an effective outlet for stress reduction and personal time.

The Wellness-Educated: A key target is the individual who is already knowledgeable about wellness trends, follows health influencers, and understands the benefits of services like cold plunges and saunas.

Exclusionary Profile: Evolve actively avoids marketing to what they term "tire kickers"—individuals attracted solely by free offers who lack the financial means or lifestyle commitment to convert to a full membership.

C. Market Positioning and Strategic Differentiators

Category-Defining Model: The all-access, no-appointment model is the primary competitive advantage, making it difficult for traditional competitors to replicate.

Comprehensive Service Offering: By providing a wide array of high-demand services under one roof—including the rare combination of both traditional and infrared saunas—Evolve establishes itself as a one-stop-shop for wellness.

First-Mover Advantage: The strategy is to expand and establish a dominant brand presence in key markets to secure local foot traffic before larger competitors can co-opt the innovative model.

III. Comprehensive List of Services

Evolve's services are categorized into temperature-based therapies, light/wave therapies, physical recovery tools, and active/cognitive training.

A. Temperature-Based Therapies

Cold Plunge: Immersing the body in ice-cold water in oversized, filtered tanks to improve recovery, circulation, and skin tone.

Norwegian Sauna: A traditional high-heat sauna used for detoxification, relaxation, and boosting cardiovascular and immune systems.

Infrared Saunas: Full-spectrum infrared saunas that heat the body directly for pain relief, detoxification, and improved cardiovascular function.

Contrast Therapy: Alternating between the Cold Plunge and Norwegian Sauna ("fire and ice") to build mental and physical resilience.

Cold Compression Sleeves: Combines cold and compression therapy to reduce inflammation and accelerate muscle and joint recovery.

B. Light & Wave-Based Therapies

Red Light Therapy: Uses low-wavelength red light to stimulate collagen and cell regeneration to improve skin texture and reduce wrinkles.

Tri-Vibe Experience: An immersive meditation aid using light patterns to enhance creativity, memory, and cognition.

Vibration Therapy: A vibrating platform used to increase muscle and bone strength, boost circulation, and reduce joint pain.

C. Physical & Mechanical Recovery

Compression Sleeves: Systematic air compression sleeves that increase blood flow to muscles for recovery.

Zero-Gravity Massage Chairs: High-tech chairs that replicate human touch with customized precision and optional heat.

Foam Rolling Station: A dedicated area with tools for self-myofascial release to relieve tension and improve mobility.

Percussion Massagers: Handheld "massage guns" that provide deep, percussive therapy to break up muscle knots.

D. Active & Cognitive Training

Cognitive and Neurotraining: A state-of-the-art touchscreen lightboard system to train reaction time, decision-making, and hand-eye coordination.

Interactive Stretching & Yoga: A self-guided space with interactive courses, mats, and props for practice.

Guided Meditation: A dedicated space for focused meditation to de-stress and improve brain function.

IV. Pricing & Revenue Model

Evolve's pricing is structured to maximize recurring revenue while using single-use passes as a strategic tool to achieve its primary goal of increasing foot traffic.

A. Tiered Monthly Membership Plans

4 Visits Membership: $89 / monthly

8 Visits Membership: $139 / monthly

12 Visits Membership: $189 / monthly

Unlimited Membership: $299 / monthly

B. Single Access Option (The Foot Traffic Driver)

Day Pass: Standard Price: $49

Strategic Role: This pass is not treated as a primary profit center but as the business's most crucial foot traffic acquisition tool. Promotional discounts (e.g., to $24.50) are used to lower the barrier to entry and entice qualified individuals to physically experience the lab. The conversion from a day pass visitor to a long-term member within the facility is the key to sustainable growth.

C. Other Payment & Access Information

HSA/FSA Reimbursement: Evolve advertises the ability for customers to use Health Savings Account (HSA) or Flexible Spending Account (FSA) funds, making their services more accessible.

Off-Menu Plans: The company utilizes unlisted, lower-cost plans as a retention strategy for members considering cancellation.

D. Franchise-Level Revenue
The corporate entity generates revenue through franchise fees and manages a collective "Brand Fund," contributed to by franchisees, for system-wide marketing initiatives.

Call Transcripts with the owners for more context:

 We're doing good, man. We're actually we're in Austin actually. We're going to we went to a concert last night and then we have one tomorrow. So we're like, well, we might as well just go. There you go. Yeah. And then tomorrow night it's the black keys. Oh, wow. Black keys should be fun. That sounds awesome. Yeah. Haram said you'll had fun, door pull and Wednesday. Yeah. I was going to see him and get to be part of the process for a minute. I feel like I need to run around. Got my cards at all times. Yeah. There you go. Oh, man, if I made a 40 year old dude that looks fit at the grocery store he's getting a day pass. I've had many in awkward like at HB, but now yeah, that's that strategy. It really works, man. And we've seen lately. The consistency of like we just have some of the works 20 hours a week going around doing events with partners and stuff. That's bringing in 20 to 50 new guests every month. So it's like, yeah, it's a recurring thing. So just to give you all full picture. This might help with M run as well. So we we definitely look at, you know, marketing and driving traffic to evolve as I was described as a lot of streams. So we're going to be a lot of people who are going to be floating into a river. You know, so that we have a consistent flow. We so we work with partners with evolve. We always say, you know, we created our own lane. So we don't do workouts and we don't do physical therapy or anything medical. So we work with local places. So often we work with gyms to capture their audience, even a rosti and some other partners. So that's that's pretty big. We still get 60% of our our new first time guests are referrals. So one of our strategies is we let guests. Hello. We met Chase. I Jeremy, I'm Chase. That's the me to you. This is me. Jason's our growth product project managers. Okay. Cool. And Courtney's here. Hi. I'm Courtney. So Chase, we're just describing some of the different ways that we drive traffic to evolve. And this is kind of high level. I know we're going to get to some more direct stuff. But since we're talking about evolve and general. I think it's useful. So yeah, partnerships and then members can bring a guest for free their first time. We get about 60% of our new new members from referrals. So it whether it's their partner friends, things like that. So we're constantly having that conversation. Especially with new members. That's a great opportunity for them to bring friends and stuff. And it's just their first time. But we tend to be generally pretty generous with passes like a first day pass when it's somebody's first time. And we can track that in the system. And then of course, we rely on digital media for what we want to be is like just a consistent flow. And my perspective like Google search is kind of the bedrock of that, you know, people that are searching for. And I really think just the heavy hitters. I want y'all's opinions. We can test whatever you think. But we try to look at the services that will actually drive traffic. And in my mind. And it's the course. Sonna would be top of the list. You can actually actually did some research into number of queries in Google based on each service in Texas and Sonna's are actually still king. So plunge is trending right now, but you're still going to see a lot more awareness and people looking for for Sonna, whether that's infrared or traditional. We can even use different terms for the Sonna like a Norwegian Sonna finished on a hot stone Sonna. There's a lot of terms around there that we want to capture. So if somebody's searching for those specific things. And I can give y'all a list of search terms if that's helpful because the Sonna world gets very deep and that's a it's a very trending thing right now. So Sonna and then red light is actually really, really high. I think last time I checked red light actually topped Sonna for searches and a lot of times anywhere else they're going to have to book an appointment and they're going to get charged 40, 30, 40, 50 bucks for red light therapy may not be good quality. So that's a big one that's included and we'll have two red light booths at this, you know, at a brown rock. We only have one in San Antonio, but Dallas has two and then coal plunge is. And I think those would be the main ones, you know, we've got of course a lot of other services, but when you get into searches like say massage chair. People are generally looking to purchase one. So we don't really see that as a good ad buy because we're going to be competing a lot. The price for acquisitions going to be pretty high. And it's pretty unlikely they're really looking to go enjoy on the size chair just from our experience. And also things like guided meditation maybe like therapy, you know, because that's such a specific thing. So, you know, what we call tri vibe is a light therapy or vibro acoustic therapy. Something like that you're just probably not going to see hardly any searches for it. So yeah, I consider search campaigns, the basis. One of the reasons we're having a conversation right now is our outgoing marketing company. I'm been used to me. I thought they were pausing Google display campaigns, but they actually paused our search campaigns. I'm not completely clear on when that happened. I was just went in there to check on things and they kind of stood behind that strategy because they said cost for acquisition was too high. You know, it is San Antonio. So yeah, we're not going to have nearly the amount of searches as other places, but I don't care. You know, somebody searching for sauna. We want them to show up at our page. And we're tracking very poorly for SEO in San Antonio. So I think it's not an important yesterday. I think we need a much more comprehensive strategy. We're putting a lot more content about the heavy hitter, sauna, co plunge. You know, we can have chat GPT right 50 articles on sauna and just put them up as backlink pages, but yeah, I'm running out of getting in your area of it. Wanted to give you some background on where we're at. So I think as I said, I on the last call, I think you are sitting on a gold mine of contents. Every practice every service. We'll need to be added is a prefix and a suffix of a sentence. For example, near me, sauna or sauna, near me, things like that. So there needs to be all permutation of combination of words. And the biggest thing I need, we need is density of the right keyword on the website. Okay. So this is how Google actually prioritizes you. So how we do increase the density. So that's why the content needs to be aligned. Then needs to at least stand or more use cases of the keywords. So the Google will prioritize you think this side actually serves or provides sauna services, right. One more thing you talked about is Google search. It doesn't have to be too expensive. You can just have something very nominal. Geobased Google search like, staying in the like five dollar ten. It doesn't have to be that expensive. So depending on your audience, that's what I'm going to say. If you spend like bucket lot of money, that's a different story. If you have the audience to set up, you can have it running silently piece by piece. And at the top of this is Google Maps. We talk about Google Maps. That's the king of everything, right. So you have to structure some campaign around Google Maps. Like, hey, give us a check in and it'll give you tenderlar coupon, things like that. So it's going to be physical and digital combination of a combined the combined attention here. Right. So what we can do and we already did some keyword research on the website and we found we you need to add more density on all the keywords you just mentioned. Yeah. And for example, cold plant is super trendy, super viral, but maybe not that popular in terms of service acquisition, but it is more viral, right. People read about it, but never actually does it. That's what I think about cold plants. And so on I is like very common service everybody buys it. This is what I'm I was going to say about. So whichever is more attractive keyword for audience to look into to learn about to see other people do it is what we should we should do it. And there's there's a section call UGC user generated content. You also have a huge volume of UG. Every customer is basically a potential source of the content that we can play with. And I'm going to pass it to taste. If you have any thoughts on what Jeremy said. Because I can see the content is the biggest game here and running ads based on the understanding from the content. We can do it several a bit of sting. For example, it can be be testing on the son or base. We can have three or four ads running at the same time. See which one picks up. Then we invest more on the one that actually picks up. Right. That's how we should move forward with it. And also the website is a low volume website is a long term investment as I mentioned. Website and YouTube is a long time investment. It may not give you a result. But it's going to give you a good result over like one year or six months of time. As you know, Google is very slow. Some is very slow in in terms of creating a new market. Google values are website every three to four months. But massage results may pop up very quickly. But overall domain value will be changing in three to four months maximum six months. So it takes time for you to see how much value you're getting. How much value your domain is getting over a quarter. Yeah, everyone you covered a lot of good stuff there. Nothing not a ton for me to add other than one idea that I think would be really good. So I think some some different kinds of shops do this is like local community events and challenges. A lot of that can go viral and I think that would be something that would work really well. You definitely care for with like health concerns and stuff, but like a cold plunge challenge like this there. And so you come in you can get a. And it's really good. We are in a very, very good. We did we couplunge almost 100 people at the same time. That was pretty fun. Without we'd get better PR for but it was right during the S. So it didn't get in it didn't catch on at any new stations or anything, but it was fun. Gotcha. Yeah, for sure. I think stuff like that though would be really fun to do first of all, but I think that could bring on a lot of people who are maybe on the edge. Like, oh, like a challenge can be a community thing. I think planning something out obviously that would need more planning kind of just a hypothetical thing, but I've seen some different people do stuff like that and it's worked really well. Yeah, that's really good. I was going to say, Jeremy, if you have. Yeah. Sorry, I said, please go ahead. I was just going to ask, I was saying, Chase, I think that's good because there's actually a strong market for charity events in Austin where people are always trying to come up with different views and like. You know, we'll we'll match fight. We'll donate five bucks for your person who gets in the full of plunger something like that being part of that story. The foot traffic. You know, I really want to focus a little bit on the now because this is not a new business. This is I want to make sure there's absolutely zero backsliding even though we are also full of ideas and helping launch roundrock. That's the new part for us with this is application. So can you walk me through like what is working now and what absolutely must maintain or increase. Yeah, and that's our frustration. We, you know, in San Antonio, we saw leads just greatly drop off and that's why I was in there kind of poking around and they've kind of exhausted our our manicured meta campaigns a little bit because, you know, San Antonio, we're it's not like Austin where we're going to have a, you know, we're on the unhealthiest city list compared to healthiest city list. We always enjoy the fact that we feel like we've we've made it successful despite our demographics in San Antonio, but we have to we have to constantly be marketing and staying out in front of it. And you know, we were with the company is called y'all, by the way, so if I say y'all, I'm not referring to you and referring to the so I'll try to say the company y'all, so there's no confusion, but they put in a pretty good effort initially and they improved our. Our ads on meta initially, but they kind of exhausted them and they, you know, the same people are seeing the ads multiple times I don't think they're getting creative enough. We do limit it to a 10 or 15 mile radius and we don't want to go outside of that because one thing that's really important for everybody understand is that we're our gold client is somebody that's going to come two to three times a week. And they're going to keep that membership for years so. This is a membership model in the best way for everyone to grow is to bring in people that can be members. So what we what we learned very early on in San Antonio is our first marketing company. I caught them on Google with a really wide radius so you looked at the map of San Antonio where our members lived and it was a shotgun. It was literally everywhere and we had a hard time retaining those members because if you have to drive 30 minutes to get to a goal. You're not going to keep your membership very long so it's it's really important that we keep that targeted even with events. I've had to go back and talk to my event person like hey you didn't event at this gym across town. That's not going to be a long term member our lifetime values over a thousand dollars in San Antonio even at our lower price point and average length of membership is 14 months. So that's really great that we have to make sure we're bringing in the people that can retain a membership over a long period of time. So what was working in February when we got the highest number of foot traffic from Google ads that we've ever had before. Yeah, so I think what's been a pain point for us the last two to three months is they started pulling back on those search campaigns. They got focused on just like cost for bringing somebody in. But you know we you know always if somebody's searching for our services we want to play in that game. I don't think they were being creative enough on the actual ads for those search campaigns. They've also never. They said that YouTube was ineffective for them. I think they just don't have any experience with it and we were just getting a really poor. And you know offering for that. So I think my gut right now is that we need to pull back on our meta budget. You know we've exhausted that audience for the last two years. That's where the budget primarily was. I think we need to limit that maybe try new things try new retargeting focus a little bit more potentially on either. And so we have a lot of energy. So we've been trying to make sure that we're not going to have a lot of tech talk which we've never you know really played around with. And YouTube but also making sure that our search campaigns are optimized because we're losing to competitors that shouldn't even be anywhere in our realm. We did just start doing. What is it user generated content where one of us so our social media person in house test. We're doing some ads through her account and we're also going to start that through our GM's account because they have really robust followings and they're willing to do that. So I was going to say teacher. Could be a book. Oh my I don't know if you have discovered a TikTok actually works very well. And especially for content that like the the coal plants campaign had like hundred people side up right. So that's a one time thing. It may not make sense. To run the campaign again because he's spanned expires right you did the event like 10 years ago or maybe two months ago. But TikTok is a medium where you can take piece of a content and you can revive it. You can reposition it. It's just whatever say take a piece of it make a small TikTok and push it again. So that content can be giving you more attention over the time. It's just after you you have to be creative and after slice out which part of the video like again. Like again, compression 10 minute video into like 30 seconds. Oh I think we lost him. And just trying to have this video I think. I'm sorry. I was just just excited. So what else can I say? Especially the services that both and involved offers their huge view on short, reals and TikTok. Instagram is a good thing but people who comes to search a real customer. That's like one tear of your customer. People who discover you that would be Twitter and YouTube in my opinion. Because we see this every day in our business. TikTok and YouTube is the YouTube is a long-term investment. TikTok is a short-term investment. That's how you see it. If you want quick attention you stick to if you want long-term credibility you see it. That's not the market works. Facebook gives you traffic. You bring traffic with Facebook because Facebook tends to change their algorithm every week. So whatever works to it doesn't work tomorrow. Facebook knows their business. YouTube knows their picture also knows their picture. So they're all kind of knows which type of audience they capture. For a business you need to have regular Google presence. You need to have regular Facebook presence. And you need to have a long-term goal with YouTube. Short-term goal with TikTok. That's it. Whatever content you create can be repurposed every platform. So if you run a campaign today maybe there's a campaign is over on Facebook. But I can take the content. Make it a short 30 second, 60 second clip with the sound bit with whatever tempo. And post it on TikTok. That means you can resell the same content in multiple channels. It depends on obviously if you're still targeting their audience. But I think this is how the whole thing should be connecting together. New audience, how should the new audience be targeted? How should the old audience be reachar-gated? How should you build loyalty? All this should be within the content plan. Not just only posting ads. Yeah. Totally agree. Chase for your say something. Okay. I was just agreeing with the TikTok thing. I definitely agree. I think TikTok's a really good thing. Yeah. I see that stuff on Marlottom. Yeah, I think it's a good opportunity. I think it's a good opportunity. I think it's a good opportunity. I'm just going to bring awareness. For sure. I see. Yeah. Yeah. So I heard meta ads somewhat exhausted. Black and creativity. Practice of keeping geo targeting online and we're teaching to try more on YouTube and TikTok. What else needs to be managed? Yeah. The Google ads they turned the search campaigns back on. But I think those could use a tune-up and make sure they're using the correct words. I'll probably go in there. I can't. And I'm dangerous enough I can play around, but I don't know the strategic back end. And you know, potentially what are the things we need to do on the website so that those Google search campaigns are more effective. And just one more quick thing that is starting to kind of start to look like a good option is we're meeting with all today. So what I'm starting to see is kind of like what you guys are doing, Isaiah, if we've got a local team on the ground that can help us capture content and keep things fresh and new and that but I don't fully trust them on for the back end. They're tech knowledge to me feels like a little concerning of actually operating the back end of these ads on Google and meta. So I see you guys as obviously very strong on the tech side and the content you know editing and whatnot. So what I'm thinking is if we can get all of the locations where they're working with all for content, especially during the pre-opening phase and then ongoing, they're handing that information off to you guys where y'all are managing the campaigns. Back to me, works off of everybody's strengths and if we can get everybody doing the same thing, then there's going to be cross-pollination and also makes our lives a little bit easier. And I would say two, I think one of the biggest struggles since we were working with y'all is like, yeah, I think part of it is now we're at your three and so you know, growing at this point is just a little bit. But we also like the creative side, we don't expect green pants to do the creative but give us feedback about what you need is what we always ask. Like is there footage that you're wanting or there words that you're wanting to like, you all are the ideas that you all are the experts in this space and we can like we don't have that feedback. So you know what you're looking for. Not performing. Yeah, you know what works. You guys can tell all directly like, all right, we need a video of somebody going from the Copeland Sonnen red light because we're going to run this ad and then that can happen quick enough. They seem pretty responsive. They've also got creative ideas, the part of their philosophy, which I do kind of agree with is if something works well organically on social media, that's potentially a good ad because people are if we see that people are responding to it, then let's figure out a way to turn that into a sneaky ad that they don't really see come and go ahead and run. Yeah. So I was going to cut you on that. So we try to keep 20% of our time within the work budget for new for discovery, like the one you mentioned, right. I can keep throwing ads every day. It's going to be a bit. I read both. It's going to be everything. You learn that. So what we do try to add 15 to keep 15 to 20% to generate new ideas. So just three category that we use to generate new ideas. Number one is the content. So we find all the synonyms, all the catchphrases, the prefix and suffix of sauna, cold plants. So that's the recurring thing. You may discover a new town, new word, tomorrow there is associated with sauna. Right. So that's what the content is. It's a regular thing. It has to be a weekly thing that we add to our grocery, with our dictionary of terms. Then we need to do research. Like a regular research on keywords which keywords is popping up on Google. You go, you pop them around. So then you can target those keywords more accurately. And the third part is basically generating lots of lots of content. So as I said, search engine values you by the content density. The drug values you buy your trend. So tick talk. For example, today maybe something called Tesla is very going trendy. So tick talk knows which content user wants to watch. And they push that content organically. So you can save a lot of money if you can write one of those organic trend. That's what we try to write on. If you can catch one ride, that's going to give you like million moment of that you can ever buy. You can never buy that momentum. So we always try to figure out a niche. Always try to catch one of the trend. Like if you can catch one trend every six months, that's like million dollar miles there you can never buy with money. So this is a regular thing that we try to incorporate with the network of it. Okay, that totally makes sense. I think the struggle in the past was that one of our creatives was trying to get us to do trending things on Instagram. And we're really not about that. But I'm open to doing that for tick talk, right? Because it is a quicker fast review. And some of the, we can, we could ask some of our influencers to do that if there are already doing tick talk trendy things to just incorporate an evolved trend. Yeah. I was just a real quick. What am I issues with the company that we're leaving is that they were responsive when there were issues with the campaigns not proactive. So that's why I really, I was not in my head a lot to 20% should always be testing new things because if you're not prepared for the new, the, what's going to replace what's eventually going to stop working, they're all going to stop working. But they were always coming to us like, okay, this quit working. Now let's try and create something new. So we were always kind of more responsive rather than proactive. So I really appreciate that proactive thing. Like you, it's going to have to change constantly. And that's the hard thing about marketing is you have to, you have to constantly be testing and trying new things. And then when something works, hammer it until it doesn't work anymore. So thank you for that. That's, that's good to hear. Go ahead, I did. Okay, sorry, I'm going to do the thing that I usually do. What else to manage now that absolutely can't drop? Do we need to make sure we're taking on? They really weren't doing that much. They were actually like, I mean, we're meeting with them every two weeks and they gave us, they were good communicators. I just think they, they weren't as savvy and like I said proactive about. And they really couldn't do any content creation. So they would be like, all right, now we need to do a campaign, go get some content. And we, we really haven't had a good success with content creators in San Antonio. Test is starting to step up. But I would say, yeah, clear directives on what you need now too. So it's really just what, what can't drop now is the Google, like, paid advertising. That's the, the bulk of the things things we can dream about in the future are of course expanding that. But I think expanding that meaning like the website right. And we can even for now, if we want to start looking at YouTube, certainly we can start TikTok immediately. We've got that channel stood up. Possibly. We have an old channel. Yeah, we do, no, we have a YouTube channel. So what's, and I'll give you a little background. This actually probably be helpful is the offer. Since we're established, it's very different from what we're doing for round rock, which is purely talking about memberships because, you know, the goal for round rock is selling founders memberships. That's everything. So we actually kind of hide the idea of day passes because we don't want them thinking, like, oh, I'll just wait and buy a day pass when they get open. So we try to avoid that conversation because we need those founders memberships. Whereas in San Antonio and Dallas, and by the way, we would be talking about Dallas as well because the company YOL is handling both campaigns. So it would be switching for both. And I can have that conversation with Kurt and do an introduction. But the important thing is we've tried a lot of different offers to see what drives traffic. And while we want to get as many feet in the door with day passes as we can, we also want those to be the right type of person that will potentially have a membership. So first thing we tested was free day passes. And that was kind of early on just to get as much traffic as we could. But what we saw was that did tend to bring entire kickers that couldn't even afford a membership. So it was, you know, not that we mind giving away a day pass to get an opportunity to membership, but that didn't bring in the best type of client. We tried by one, get one free, that didn't track as well. And then we tried 50% off. And we're currently just stating a discounted day pass price. Seems to be the leading offer for ads in general. So we'll just say kind of like half off 2450 is the offer. We would even be open to maybe if it just makes it sound easier like $20 for your first day pass. Because we need them to have some kind of a buy-in. We know they can afford to at least pay $20 for a day pass. And then we want them to, and then our cruise job in the spaces to convert that to a membership. Why don't we do any ads for like a half off your first membership? Which have to be that yet, yeah. Okay. Okay. What case, we have to give it all. Yeah. What case of posting? Yeah, what case of posting on Instagram and other social is the current case? Yeah, for Instagram, we shoot for two to three times a week. And for Facebook, I think she just, you know, we've got an employee that's managing the organic content at least. And she does a pretty good job. She has a marketing background. But as far as ads, I'm not really, I'm not really sure how often they're changing that. And, you know, to be, to say that back to you, we don't need to take responsibility for organic on Instagram and Facebook. No, I think we've got that covered. Yeah. Okay. Don't worry about organic at all, I say, we've got, we also have an intern for the summer through a program here in Santa. So we typically have in marketing interns in the summer who help us capture content. They already sent over to more videos. Okay. Great. So not taking responsibility for Instagram and Facebook, organic. And everything. Okay. That's right. It's the same for Dallas, too. Isaiah. Dallas, person who does all their organic content. So you wouldn't have to worry about that. That's where we say, like, if you have direction or guidance about what you want us to capture that would help with ads, we can do that. That's great. And so, so, Im Ron and Chase, I hope you're hearing this really clearly. It's like, we can give them a shot list, right? We can give them a backlog of creative to make. But we don't have to come up with it all. What I'm picturing also is bringing all to the picture is if we, if we limit what they're having to do, like, they're not having to run the ads because I just don't have confidence for them. You guys obviously are much higher level for actually running the ads. But since they can be our on the ground team to get some of that more polished content. Like, if we need higher level content for YouTube that's going to be that long term building confidence in the brand expert content, that type of stuff, I can get with them. We can, you know, we can get content from them over the board. So what I'm seeing is paying a monthly fee to all, that's a little bit smaller, just to get continuous content generation. Local team does the in-house day to day posting. And then you guys are running all of the ads, SEO, YouTube, strategy, all that kind of stuff. And I would just share two though, I say, like, we were very impressed with what Green pants can do with raw footage and cutting and all of that. So also would be open if there's bandwidth for that from you all for the occasional like video if you're able to put something together because those have been everything you're going to the ground rock has been beautiful. Yeah, would you just want to be able to drive more content to you also you can, as Immer on saying, like, let's create a lot more so that we can get a lot more out there because it is, I mean, Gary V says it all the time, it's a volume thing. So that's, that's, that's the only reason that I think alt can be helpful is we can just drive more content, maybe some higher quality content that you guys can cut up and use however you need. So on the topic of Dallas, Centenonia and Round Rock, I'm trying to look at how do we bundle or how do we help each other be most effective across these stacks when you're all thoughts on that? Yeah, it's, it's a little bit tricky because this basis looks slightly different, but I actually sent alt to Dallas so that we could capture some footage of Dallas because Round Rock is going to look more like Dallas than San Antonio and especially if you're talking about a massage chair and you've got a tight shot, it doesn't matter which location is, but I think at some point when we're talking more about the different locations, you know, if Kurt does a really great video where he's talking about red light, but it's in Dallas, I think we can still use that in San Antonio and Round Rock and just kind of lean into the idea that we've got, we're a bigger brand. We've got three locations open and then Austin will be right behind y'all for locations. And we're kind of picturing a hub where the good content can be put so that y'all can access it and there is some of that cross migration of ideas and content which I think just makes everybody's brand look better, everybody's location look better. I think one of the interesting things about this too is when it comes to the analytics side, I'm sure all the owners would love the prevention marking, you know, what's working and what's not and seeing the same in all of it, right? So that's why everybody working under one company. And by the way, so we pay for like each location, they can pay green pants directly. That's why we've been doing it for y'all. The better thing is having to go through the franchise, we may do that at some point if this goes well, just you'll know what I'm picturing is, green pants basically becomes our, we can even make it required marketing company so that everybody is on the same page. Y'all know we don't usually like to require stuff, but if this is going really well and we want to take a variable off the table for franchisees, there's marketing is about the most important thing that we can do because we know how to run a facility. Marketing is just it's constantly changing and it's a variable that can make her break a location. So if, you know, if this goes well, we want the sure thing where we say we've got in-house marketing and if that needs to come through the franchise or if it goes directly y'all, that's the vision long term. And Isaiah for that, I'll share because you mentioned benchmarking, I think something to just be aware of is that Dallas is very not very involved at all. And there's we manage that. Share me in high room, sit in on those meetings and then Kurt does get a report, but he is not an in the weeds person at all. He will have some, he'll have some feedback or some questions, but he's, it's really not something that's on his plate and we're very opposite owner's on. Yes, yeah, we're incredibly opposite, which is why we are so excited about working with you in Sam too, is because yeah, it's very, and I'll say to for Austin, the, Austin O'Kill location that's coming on, Brian will likely not be very involved either. So we will be driving it like we, you, you in green pants and the franchise will really be driving that. So benchmarking is important for us and we are keeping eyes on it, but our, our disease, our other disease are not super involved in it. Just so, yeah, wherever that plans. Yes, yes, that's very helpful. Okay, so what conversion metrics you were talking about day passes and then I was also just wondering why the pack versus how you measure thoughts or lead or other trigger points in the funnel, what are the ones that you pay it and cheat you? Yeah, I mean, I think cost for acquisition is, you know, is a good metric to look at, because I, you know, what I would like to have seen more from previous companies we work with is is really charting out, you know, what is it costing on each channel and then what, but, you know, you can't focus too much on that. Like I said, they basically took Google search out because it was costing more, but that doesn't mean that it's not one of the tools that we have to use. You know, outside of that, you know, volume is still important. We need to, you know, when they're working well, by the way, Dallas does about 25% better than San Antonio, like at the same budget, they'll get a lot more leads per add their cost per acquisition is lower. So we, we really need to get back San Antonio back. We've, we've hit numbers of like 60 to 80 in San Antonio and when they dropped off, we, we saw like 20 last month and I think a big part of that was they took down the, the search ads, you know, obviously, we need to get back to those higher numbers. And as far as my location, I will keep driving more money toward it. If we see this stuff working consistently, we just, we, we saw this roller coaster of inconsistency from them and it, it makes us timid when it comes to adspin. So I go ahead and run. I was going to, I was just anxious to tell you something here. So cost per acquisition actually a magic number because you can be tactical with it. How you don't need to spend a lot of money every time. So I can have a range of cact like, for example, I would only pay 20 cents. So the Google will know when to push your hands. If it's not fully important, you don't need to push it to a higher beat because it's a RDB system real time beating. So all ads system or RDB, the beat for ad position every single second. Right. So now let's say we decided to push air in the morning. So I don't need to pay a lot of money at the evening or maybe at the night night 10. It depends on my strategy. You can have a range of expenditure and say I'm not going to pay more than 30 cents. Fine. You said that number, Google will pull. All right. Well, we wait on him. How do you want us to manage ad spend ups and downs? What's the range there? I like to keep the spend pretty consistent. It's just if we have somebody that's a little bit more responsive. Oh, and then he's gone cheaper ads. I just would like a like we need a few more outlets. So basically they were just relying, you know, three quarters of the budget on Instagram and Facebook and then Google was kind of like an afterthought. If we have, you know, a few more. Sorry, I'm run you, you froze on us. I'll let you finish your thought though. So I was going to say, I don't know how much you had said I was going to say you can plan your expense. Right. So if you don't want to spend a lot of cash, you can plan your spend less than 30 cents or one dollar. So you can position your ad and ask Google to only display ad when the cost feeds so much in. So, you know, Google is an RTB system as I said, it's a real time feeding system. So whatever margin you put at, Google will run your ad when the margin hits your range. Right. So you can control it. Second thing you should reserve some budget for highly crowded market like a Christmas, like a new year season. Like, oh, you know, you need to invest all of a pack. So this is what I'm going to say, if you say, you can see, then fine, don't go into the expensive tier play with the non expensive side. So you run your ad in the morning, run your ad in the evening. So that's the like low price strength timing for your ad. So you can time and budget based on your urgency, based on your need for attention. Second thing I was going to say, if you measure cost per acquisition, you have to measure lifetime value too. So how do you know, acquisition is worthless. You don't know how it is a lifetime bill. A customer could be paying you $10,000 over lifetime, but maybe you're spending too much to who are the customer right now. So you never know if it's too much or too low, unless you have a measurement way. Right. So most one is most companies try to measure in two year or three year lifetime value, right, because you know, if a customer moves out of Texas or somehow gets married or whatever reason. So let's say three year lifetime value, you can calculate. If you have that number, KAC actually doesn't make make that sense, right? Third measure, I'm going to say is run a low profile ad all the time. So try to catch low budget traffic. So there are slots in a two in different times when we actually have a low budget ad. Find those low budget time and try to run those ads on your low budget period. So you don't have to always spend a lot of money. That's what I'm trying to say. Right. Yeah, and I'm not sure if if you're on when I was saying, I don't mind putting more budget to things, but we just want to see a little bit more consistency and I think having more channels, you know, so that if we need to shift budget from one to the other, you know, I prefer to give you all that bandwidth, you know, where we say like the budget is $3,500 a month, where are we getting the best, you know, again, like let's not turn off search ads because that's also we're competing for that. So I don't want to hand somebody a lead for a sauna customer just because, you know, we we tapped out on a certain budget. So it's funny. I actually told the previous company like, make sure we've got enough so that we don't stop showing up and then they somehow turn that into turning it off. But, you know, that's a competition, you know, if we if we pull out for for that competition, we just made it cheaper for them to get a guest, you know, from a sauna search. So that's why I don't know. It's I don't know if I'm just bullish on that. Does that make sense to you as a like, okay, yeah, it just, it's no common sense to me. I don't know what happened, but you know, you know, Google, Google has over 200 places where you can not just search even search as a multiple layer of display center. It's a desktop, mobile, Android, Play Store, Gmail, you just have like 200 plus positions you can play with, right? So it's not always that straightforward. Yeah. If I was there, I'm going to pick five positions and I'll see which position works better. I'm going to change those five position every month. See, which position actually brings you the right customer, right? So it's not a single thing like Google, I had Google search. It's actually a beta sting over all the placement, Google offers, and see which placement actually brings you most of it. Yeah. And start date for this Isaiah, what also be July one, right? Or, well, no, or then like they're they're done at the end of the month, but I would rather be a little bit of overlap so that you guys have a runway, you know, we could get started. And whenever next week, I'll give you a full access so that you can see what's currently operating it. It should give you some historic data on both meta and Google Adwords. And then by the time they're done, you guys can, you know, push forward the new ideas or whatnot. But I'd rather there be some overlap so that we're, you know, we don't have a dead period. That's perfect. Yeah, because our first task will be get our hands around the tools, analyze them, see what we think creatively, but then we also need to have a brief like, did you already try that period? You know, because I don't ever want to pull off an idea that you already did. Mm-hmm. Yeah, we can definitely. And yeah, one more thing is that next couple of months as Jan and I told you, we'll be doing a lot of evitesting. So everything we do, we'll have multiple copies. Every ad we'll have three copies, every campaign we'll have three copies. So because we don't, we are very sure that we don't, we are not leaving anything out. The more tests you are, the more discovery is actually free research. You don't have to work on it. You just throw three types of ads, see which one picks up. And we will do this continuously in a couple of months. So that you figure out how much budget, for example, out of the three or 3500 budget, you can fix 70% on proven channels, proven positions. You can keep the 30% on experimental channels where it is called new ways where you can run the ad. So you cannot like you shouldn't always run the ad on known channels. How do you discover new channels? You do only spend on new areas, right? That sounds perfect. Okay. Well, you go back to my list. I had one more big and oh yeah, I have two big ones. Continue on the analytics side. I don't often do you take it reports in what are you looking at now? They would, so we would meet with the previous marketer, every two weeks, higher than I would get on. And they would mostly go over the the budget per channel. So it was basically broken up for meta and Google. They would tell us the amount spent and the number of conversions that we had. So not super, super in depth. I wouldn't mind. I like the data. So I don't get overwhelmed by it. So that would be great if we could meet with your team every two weeks and the like Courtney sent. We kind of operate Dallas for them. In the sense that we're trying to optimize it and it's something they don't have to mess with everybody wins in that scenario. We just want all locations growing. So we're happy to invest the time. And also, we use brand fund strategically. Like brand fund for us, like we're not running national ads. So sometimes we've done it like we just paid all to go to Dallas to get content from there. And we use brand fund for that because brand fund should directly benefit each individual location. Until we can run a Texas wide ad or something like that, which is still pretty far out. We want you guys. We want that money to be directly beneficial. So there's, of course, it's not huge. San Antonio pays into it and Dallas, but especially once you're running, that can be part of the conversation. But, you know, we just want to see what you're peeking in it. Yeah, every two weeks looking at the numbers kind of seeing where it's spending. Oh yeah, we got about 10 minutes. So talking about retention marketing. Yeah. Yeah. You know, with the op spec, we, part of the reason we like it is it keeps our, our guests and leads organized. Pushpress just doesn't really have a process for that. Once they're in pushpress, we consider them like a one customer because they get pushed over there. But op spec or what's the other name for it? Go high level. Yeah, that's what I say. And I was at as we can do target. We can do retargeting through email or text. And so we're, we're still trying different things in there. But I know we can upload those lists either from, from either channel where we can drop that into meta or Google and say like, hey, these are like, I've had no for it for sure. We've done like members. So we know these are people that are that long term gold standard client. Let's use that in meta. I don't know how well that was used, but I know that was a strategy that we discussed. Yeah, Emma. I was going to, I was going to say retargeting an email in texting definitely works. But can we be liberty? No, we have with this prep for example, if you know a customer came to use six months ago, can we just send a text here if you're in a book a 10 minute consultancy with us, just give us an opportunity. So ask them to have a consultancy like, how was your experience? Do you need this support? So is it possible to mix up like five minutes in a week or five minute free consultancy, five minute free support with very tension? Yeah. And we do have Liz who follows up with guests. So if somebody came in and used the day pass, but they did not convert to a membership, they're going to get a phone call so that we have another opportunity and she, she does fairly well with that. Well, we're about to stand up for retention. One for new members. So during their first 30 days, they're going to get a text. They're going to get some follow up emails so that they understand the importance of creating the habit. But we're also, as a dialysis doing this, and we're about to start is doing an offer for folks who cancel like six months ago, they canceled their membership, giving them an offer for half off their first month back with us. So we'll see how that works. What is the, just asking, is there any cancellation funnel right now active? If somebody wants to cancel? No, they don't plan. We don't have, well, we have a, we do have a they can downgrade. So if somebody's the most, the number one reason for cancelations is I'm not able to make it to, I'm not able to use services as often. I was, as I would like. And so we tried to get them to downgrade. We even have a completely off menu plan where the lowest plan is four a month, but we're offering downgrading to two a month. It hasn't proven, it hasn't saved anybody yet. So we're probably going to just do away with that. But that's the main thing. Summer for us in San Antonio, we see some because we have a lot of teachers or seasonal folks who come with us. And so we're, we're thinking about a summer plan. Some flexibility there. But yeah, we don't have any cancel. We don't, we don't have a contract and we don't have any fees. So, you know, yeah, we try not to make it terribly difficult for people to cancel, but they do have one hoop they have to jump through where they have to fill out a form. Because we want to be able to win them back. But you can't just make it a button on their app, you know, it's, it makes a banana website. Hey, that I have now exhausted. I request some thank you. Anyone else? Something they want to ask for to say. I think, yeah, we, we, it will be helpful for us to do some research because pastoral, from my site, my team would be doing a lot of content research with Isaiah and the and Chase will be doing a lot of messaging and fixing up a grocery for you. So grocery is the most important, but I believe because you need to find a lot of synonyms for the same word. Let's have Google works. Yeah. You have to cover all the basics. There's no other is. And I'm going to say we need to come up with some fixing methodology for the website because a lot of the traffic will come into website and maybe find a way to reach them back later. And set up a, we, we call a growth stack. So you'll connect the growth stack to your system, like to your website to your Facebook. So there we can see everything coming in. And this process would give us a really personalized experience of how we should start investing your money on it. I did think of something that'll be relevant for you guys. We've also tried two different things for leads coming in. So, for, in order for them to make a purchase, they have to go directly to, or they need a land on push press where they, they basically put in their name, phone number, email, and then buy that day pass. So that has to be, that's the conversion. We've tried two different things where they either go to a landing page where they can gather more information. And then there's a purchase now link on there. Or a lot of times we haven't just go straight to the, the purchase page. There's two theories there. You know, you add an extra click if you have them go to the landing page, but they gain more information. If they go straight to the purchase page, they may click off because they don't have enough information. So we're, we're kind of, you know, again, that's a, a, a, a, a, a testing type thing. My current understanding, high-rump might have more information on this is that we saw slightly better, only a little bit better conversion when they went straight to the purchase page. Because so we can do either one. And I believe we have conversion tracking with either a post purchase page or something like that, but, you know, there's a, right after the purchase. Yeah, there's a green direct. So we can, we can provide that. Who the pixels are whatnot. But we can track it Google and everywhere. This is a conversion tracking is available everywhere. What I was going to say is that we check out extremely important. I know you know Amazon does it very well. Because the longer time you make the maker customer with the longer it gets the, the chance of getting it, it's checking out is very risky. So he has to be there whenever customer is thinking about it, the first situation should check out. Yeah, he's the best way. That's what we've seen. So yeah, as a, if you all could put together a quote, again, I can Dallas should be very easy, but we'd probably just do an introduction call so they can meet Jolens. But if they, they follow our lead on that type of stuff and other than that, and we'll kind of same with float. Oh, we're y'all waiting on this for anything for float. Okay, just make sure. But yeah, I mean, I think we're excited because I feel like y'all are going to be a huge upgrade. And I also like that you'll get an insight into what it's going to be like after you open. So y'all can be prepared because it's, it's a very different, you know, the campaigns and the strategy, everything shifts to a different mode once you're open. And it becomes entirely day passes. You know, we still want to drop in membership awareness so that they come in. They, they know that's going to be part of it. But I think this will really help you all on the next phase because you'll already have some insights. And I think you're going to help us grow faster. San Antonio, you know, we're really frustrated the last few months, you know, with the lack of leads, you know, if you don't have foot traffic, you, you can't grow. So we're ready to turn the spick it back on. Got our crew closing well right now. So we just need to get them more leads. Perfect. I love everything about this. Thank you all for trusting us. And yeah, we're, we're working hard to build the right proposals here and we'll have that for your next. Sounds great. You'll have a great weekend. Thanks y'all. Nice to meet you. Bye bye.

 So kind of place you go through Number two, yeah So we're doing I'm matriculating my way over to Huntsville, Texas today because today is debate coaching day at the prison that I coach out for rehabilitation. So I'm meeting actually the other guy who coaches with me. He was a former champion debater and he works at an AI company here as their top salesperson. So we're meeting up in Elgin to a carpool or else Yeah, because you're like, you don't want to have to drive everyone separately any further than that. Yeah, so Are you all expecting Courtney today? Before we kick off or should we go ahead and get this party started? I'm not sure Jeremy are yet. Yes, I know. I'm not at the kitchen table today, so I normally have to be a bit of a turn until you. Sorry, I didn't realize my audio was it on. Yeah, no court's not going to not be meeting with us. I'll be on screen, but I can hear you guys. Great. Okay. Well There we go. Let's go ahead and get started. We are just so delighted to welcome you all to work with you and we got this whole team here ready to listen and in taking it started. We scheduled this meeting to be fast because you had some pain and problems around ads. And so I want you to meet some of your team real quick and then let's jump straight into ads. So Chase, if you don't mind running some intro for a second of yourself and I want to make sure they understand that you and us here are both going to be taking a lot of responsibility in the ad area so I will make sure they hear a little bit about each of you. Go ahead Chase. Hey guys, Jeremy, I know I've met you before. Good to see you. Here you are. Is that how you say your name? Hi, Ram. Yeah. Great to meet you. I'm Chase. I do growth kind of management here at Green Pass. So I manage all the different growth projects. Make sure kind of our team is staying on pace and I also like to get down and dirty and actually work on the different projects as well. So I'll be helping a Seer Hill talk in a second and do some self. I'll be helping them specifically with your. Google and meta ads. Making sure those are optimized, especially making sure that we're just getting. Lots of lead flow through there is going to be the goal. To actually kind of convert those ads into actual memberships as much as we can. We know you guys had some problems with the past agencies and their creativity and so it's our job to make sure that we are creative and we're making things actually happen for you guys. So yeah, that's a little bit about me. A Seer if you would like to introduce yourself to the guys and tell them a little bit about what you do that'd be great. Your thanks, Chase. Hi, herum and Jeremy. I must say nice to meet you guys. So I actually I am in performance marketing in the last six years. I do performance marketing in Bangladesh, especially, but I have a lot of experience with Google ads, meta ads, LinkedIn ads, etc. So I all I ran almost a million dollars ads in a month while I was at agency called ADA, as you know, digital Bangladesh. So there I handed around 20 plus brands in that agency. Now I am working in a startup called Jatri, this travel tech company and I am working as a performance marketing manager here. And in Kenshin, my part is to be the perfect growth and performance manager to actually help our client grow their business with the help of the apps. Thanks, Seer. And then the next person, I don't know if you guys have met him or not, but Gideal, he does quite a bit of management on the growth team as well. Making sure everyone's kind of aligned is kind of what his job is. So Gideal, if you want to introduce yourself. Yeah, sure, thanks, Chase. Hi, Thames. My name is Gideal. So basically, I'm working as a head of products and so I work with a lot of companies in my last few years, like I worked as a head of products at several companies. So especially I work on the product's part. So I manage products management and also working on the EI first. In a can think, so basically I managed evolved roundrock projects. So especially in growth growth management and media parts and instead is it parts and those things I managed right now. So that's the thing, sexually. That's what I call that. Jenny, the poster that you both ran as a video you saw was kind of a concoctioned people from Gideal and I see them. They are on the ignition. That was my hearst. Awesome. Cool. And have you both met Emron? I know Jeremy has. Yeah. Okay, great. Okay. Well, Emrons are, you make everything happen. So you guys already know that. Very cool. Awesome. Well, here's my super professional background now. Sorry. Jeremy, we are ready. However, you want to start this to hopefully see some stuff on screens and you talk us through the fixes you've made and where it needs to go. And we'll start asking questions. Yeah. So I'll give you a brief history of what we've done in the past. I think, you know, what we can obviously you guys are the experts in the technical side of things and content creation thing break. That was a big part of why we decided to bring pants as we immediately saw some really beautiful assets from you guys. That was a shortcoming of our previous agency. They, I think they did a decent job in Meta, but I'll be curious to see you. Y'all feel free to share. Good and bad that you see once you get in these systems. I think they were really lacking in the Google ad side. I think they did a decent job in Meta, but I also feel like they kind of exhausted Meta for us. So I'll get into a little bit about the history of what we've done in the past that we felt like was successful in what kind of crash and burn. Because we've done a lot of A B testing to try and understand what's the best way to get folks into evolve. And so I'll start with that that generally what we're seeking is foot traffic into the physical location. At least for for open locations. Now round rock obviously is different. We're trying to build awareness around the brand and and sell founders memberships. So we really for anything that's that's pre-opening. We don't actually talk about day passes hardly at all. We actually kind of want to avoid the conversation around a day pass because we're focusing our entire energy on selling memberships for pre-open locations. So round rock's going to be a different strategy, but I think the cool thing about y'all working with the mall in San Antonio is you can start to plan for once round rock is open. And how that strategy kind of it literally shifts overnight from. Membership founders memberships to day pass sales. So in San Antonio initially we tried actually just free day passes because the the financial benefit of a day pass is negligible compared to for is a small amount compared to. What we get for memberships currently in San Antonio our membership our average customer link is 14 months. And the average lifetime value is is over $1100 now it kind of keeps going up. So again our our end goal is to get somebody signed up for a membership. It's a little challenging to we we really have a test of too much it's a little challenging to get people to sign up for. And the partnerships when the spaces open we founders obviously you've got the full mow and you've got you know the incentives there but for an existing location we find it easier to get people in. To experience it and then that crew in the space is their job is to sign up get the get the guests to sign up for a membership. So we initially tried three day passes but what we found was that brought in a. And so we found a little bit of a set of our little bit too low and it brought in some folks that really weren't financially. Am able to purchase a membership or they just wanted the free thing so we we proved we moved away from that strategy. We've tried full price and that really just didn't bring in enough guests. We tried by one get one free and that also just didn't really really move the traffic so we've actually. The main thing is the half off day passes been seems to be the sweet spot and we're still open to new ideas so if you guys have a thought or an idea please we're always we generally say the best. The best idea wins so if there's another way we can slice this as far as offers we're open to ideas but currently what seems to have worked the best in the past which brings in a decent caliber of guests. But also somebody you know enough traffic is the half off day pass now we can we can spend that as twenty four dollars and fifty cents or half off. I remember I think the actual dollar amount did better than the fifty percent off. It did yeah fifty percent off is fifty percent off of what was kind of the question and people didn't realize we were talking. So cheap about spa services so like the twenty four fifty really made a lot of eyes pop and they like that a lot better. Conversion rate would it just work better overall. I've had an idea for something where we show the day pass price and then like it slashes through that and then shows the half off because if we can if we can express both of the ideas like one this is a great offer. And also it's only twenty four fifty which is a really small amount for for what we're offering that might be a full idea we haven't tried it. But that again that came back to content creation where we didn't have a good team that could do that that would probably be very easy for y'all. Just a pop in there another thing that's like the lead to that journey was the idea that we were about to launch we left the last one that was like this can be used towards your membership. And that's what we do in the lab anyway and we've never told people that and the outset. So being able to communicate again we need to create a that can deliver that so glad to be talking with y'all about this. But having having that communicated to the end user that this isn't just a day fast to go try it out you want to use this towards your membership you can do that to. Yeah, and we think that would be a great idea because we want to start to plant the idea of a membership like at least make them aware that this is a membership model. Anyway, we can of course the focus is on here's the offer it's a very low price and here's what you get with that which can be part of the challenge. And so to speak specifically to the platforms. I'm personally a big fan of Google search. I think if a guest or somebody in our area is searching for something we do that's a great opportunity. I was just in there putting in negative keywords to make sure that you know those those terms don't broaden out too far so. I'm very open to having really detailed conversations about what those should and shouldn't be because it's I realize that coming into this sphere is is very unique and the wellness industry isn't isn't like other things. So I would actually prefer more communication on what those add say that the big pain point we've had in the past is. I think that's a great idea. I think that's a great idea. I think that's a great idea. Sometimes we and so if they're too far away. They're not going to be coming in regularly maybe if they work but so we generally try and keep that geographic. Area pretty tight. The most I really would like to see in San Antonio is 15 miles if we're just exhausting a group but 10 miles would be ideal if we can spread it out over more channels. Again, we see that people cancel because they're not coming in and so if we can if we can keep them closer in proximity then they're more likely to visit regularly and keep their membership. So we yeah we had we fired our first marketing company because we found out they were using a geographic area of literally hundreds of miles and they just they just punch the wrong. But in Google AdWords, but it cost a thousand dollars and ads that didn't need to be served. I recently found that the company we were just working with they have the entire city of Dallas showing for Dallas is Google ads and they acknowledge that it was a mistake but. You know that could be a 30 45 minute drive for somebody on the other side of Dallas and. Those kind of mistakes it's just you know it's taking the time to set things up properly and then going back and checking they also had keywords that had been left in there. Since they're opening things like get a founders membership, I found you know somewhere tucked away in a Google ad that they never needed and Google may not be showing that term but those kind of things can really get under my skin because I'll go in there and check and and that tells me that the ads aren't being. The main tanger or updated regularly. And as far as meta, I feel like in San Antonio, we got to a point where they were seeing the ads four or five times and obviously that's that's not great. So we we've recently kind of pulled back on the budget for that and I'm kind of feeling like we could lean into Google in YouTube. And actually just the last few days that started running ads on TikTok and the cost for click and the number of views that it's showing are. Pretty high so I don't know if that's anything you'll play around with but I might just I might just play around with it a little bit on my own to see how that looks and then we can discuss it later. So sorry, there's a common in the chat. I was just commenting to the thing with us team to give them my idea of how far away the Dallas ads are based on their city because they also have a very large sprawled city. And I think that's worth understanding is like we actually share that here is these Texas cities San Antonio and Dallas are some of the. Largest sprawled out cities in the whole United States. Yeah, yeah, go ahead, everyone. So I think this is a very interesting one. One thought comes to my mind is that probably. I know they are not with us but this is one of the easiest way to try again. Like you know, take a chunk of geographic location and so it's. So if you do take time, like if you allow some time, like go find the right tag in because we can just use the map. Find you graphical like we call it. Nearest what is it highlighted point like the business or a bank or maybe stadium. Like is there is there an mentionable premise or entity nearby. So we if we collect through those tags and throw ads that's more precise than just targeting through geographic location. Does any you target everybody even people who are not maybe not the right customer, whatever they will see this. For example, if you just use the map like if you can see the premises right here. Right, so we if you zoom deeper in, it's just take some time to do some research. Right, if you do the research properly and build a premise like this, you're tagging business main position, sports people's behavior and put those into ad before dispatching that that it takes time. This is what I'm trying to say, it takes time to prepare it, but that gives you precise. Delivery you can literally target a building even though Facebook Google have different strategy on targeting specific premises, but you still can do that. Just different hacks around it. I see you may be able to tell me where we how do you normally target geographic location if you have a customer base. I would argue thing we can. I work on this to make sure like within ten mile radius, we have a strategy to target businesses that may be. I'm not a maybe the may have accurate audience level. How do you normally. Target businesses within the premise within a geographic location. I see. So, why if we have the customers numbers, we don't need to put the location of the customers or any geographical location. First of all, cause we already give the platform the numbers and the email address platform. We only target those users on the address. The platform will not, gonna target the other users if we are not saying the platform that reach more audience to get better results. Yeah, but there's more people. If you're to get like for example, look like audiences. How effective would be the look like audience within the premise like it was in defined area. Yes, right. So if we select the look like audience or use a single audience in Google, it will. We can target as minimum as one mile. One mile in any geographical area and it's a radius. So we cannot target any polygonal thing. So. So polygonal is not. Sorry, I just want to be really clear that Joe the goal that we're going for is to reach a new audience. We can do retargeting if say if somebody has been in and they don't have a membership. So we can get some really specific target list. But we are not trying to serve ads back to folks that have been in the facility. We've got other ways to do that. And if they've been in, we're going to have their email and phone number and we're going to use direct target re targeting through text or email. So it's really important for you guys to understand that we're trying to bring first time first time visitors into a vault. That is at least for San Antonio right now again. Roundrock is a different conversation, but for San Antonio and Dallas. It's getting people in here for the first time so they can experience it because what we do. I'm sure this has been kind of expressed to you all, but what we do is very unique. There's not any other businesses that operate in the way that we do. And so one of our challenges is getting them to understand why it's better in getting our name in front of people. And one of the biggest challenges has been helping people understand what makes it unique, which is no appointments and access to everything in the facility. All of our competitors, you basically book appointments and you pay for each service. And so it's almost so different that one of the biggest hurdles is getting people to believe the value. It's kind of a funny thing because it almost seems too good to be true. And so when we we've even tried talking about specific services rather than the big wide picture and we say, you know half off your day pass to enjoy red lights on a cold lunch. Because that's something they can wrap their head around even sometimes when we say day pass they may not really understand what a day pass is. So we're trying to think of different ways where we could say, because that's what they would pay for it. Other facility they'd spend $30 just for one red light. So I'd like to get kind of, you know, specific on that where we're saying come enjoy this and that for this price and you don't have to book an appointment. Something that's real simple like that I think where people can wrap their head around it, but again, sorry, this is a little bit of the tangent, but definitely the important thing is understand like we're trying to try to make people aware of us and bring them into the physical facility with that with that offer. And so I'm going to reflect back to you some of the constraints because this is appropriate giving us the guardrails, which is. Goal is first time. But traffic in the door. The other rest of the marketing and sales tactics can take it from there. There's a lot of room for experimentation around the messaging. So if I'm having a bunch of ideas over here, which I am, we'll we'll try some of those. And because you're category defining. We have to be able to. Innovate there and that's going to make their existing categories. Challenger question. Oh, and then finally, of course, the critical success factor of around 10 miles, a mutable driving distance is correct for people. I have one question about that. What is it 10 miles from residents work or just that they happen to be around some of the time because I understand this to be a third place. Yeah, I think 10 miles. Like they live 10 miles from our ball. Isn't that what we've usually said, Jeremy? I mean, typically I like to think of it as something they're going to go to a lot of times on a weekend. But I also don't, you know, if they work near there, there's a very good chance they could stop in after work. I mean, that's going to be a big strategy with Dell, I think. And we were talking about this on the call last week. The same is starting to actually the call with all and fam starting to really figure out ways that we can target for roundrock those Dell employees and start to create a list of either. I think Sam is going to start looking and LinkedIn like who are the shift leads or managers or leadership team there, where we can put out an offer to them and bring people in. But for this for San Antonio mostly we haven't targeted. Like work locations as much as at home, but I think it's one of those two. It doesn't have to be specific to one. And then one other question I had is I just wondered. What amount of study of the existing customers have you done on this communication problem like. An example would be for the next three days. Everybody who walks out the door if your staff isn't otherwise occupied. He just asked them, hey can I ask you really quickly. What would you say to somebody or do you say to somebody who's doing other spasor versus what makes it unique and just record that because. That to me would actually be a very ideal ad when you're struggling with the lead ability is the actual people walking in and out of the facility saying it. We have data on why they came in you know like is that's kind of like part of the intake form and we have found that 40% of guests. Have work out recovery on their radar that may not be the primary reason, but that's one of them. So that's that's the largest group by far. What was number two after that, Hiram. So and it's funny work out recovery actually is up to 70% as one of the things listed. The leading one 40% of the time that 70% of the time it's one of the ones listed on there so it's a history character yeah totally. The other is relaxation was the the next one. So like looking to go somewhere to roll acts kind of deal. It was funny I think it was like 20% of respondents said that so as you huge gap down to that and then lower from there. And it's right. And it's wrong but that's their first intake right so correct after they've done it for three or six months. It's possible like like I guess one of the things I've heard and undoubtedly. Some people feel like there's a community there. Yeah and as far as I know from most online community marketing you can't ever sell the community as actually part of a thing it's something people experience. I actually go through a cohort they're like I want to talk to these people again, but if you try to sell it up front they're like I don't need a new friends. And so that's something I'm wondering. Yeah I think we have go ahead. Yeah there's I think it's a good idea Jeremy for us to share the user experience research data that we have. We've got things that people both responded to. Surveys like actual member and visitor surveys that are not just the intake form but also like what a will did before use a general manager was like a good solid three month research study for us on how the users in the space interact with it what they're interested in what like keeps them there what would make them you know want to leave. There were a lot of things we kind of learned from that and that was you know going on the previous I would say like two years of data up until that point and including some data and Dallas do because we went up there and research there as well. Yeah and I was going to share with the the workout recovery we do partner with a lot of gems so that might be slightly skewed compared to who we're bringing in from social. I don't know how I'm if we're able to to skew like to parse out that data from where they came to us from but that would be interesting to see. We certainly good I haven't yet. Yeah. We try and captures much data as we can so we can get more precise and educated on this so if there's a question about the data that you'll have we'll see if there's a way to. I don't know what's the next question you'll have because I can just ramble on what one more before we move on is that can you share or show with us I'm just trying to actually get my hands on the thing around geography. I'm pretty sure I remember seeing some cool maps or something can you. Share or draw that for us or just you're going to share my screen and like show us what smiles looks like I think that'll help us all. I could pull up smack and real quick Jeremy and literally so that we pulled around our lab. For Santa's. Yeah. What I've seen yeah what I've seen in the as usually for either Google or meta is just doing a radius around Santa. Now if we wanted to get a little bit more precise because San Antonio is very divided as far as like income we could also get into I could create as if code list if we wanted to be slightly more precise but. I don't know if that's much better than just doing your radius because it's a lot of extra work but. That's another possibility. Look alike audiences are pretty easy because we can just send over like a member list with emails and I know at least from meta they can. Because I look alike would still be good as well as still geographically targeted I think. I like these people school but attribution is another thing we try to figure out there's a number of position people intentions jobs. Attributes also the fellow behavioral attributes those are the real filtering that can help you to narrow it down to precise audience. I just want to add something here if whenever we try to. Be very specific about our placement. They're basically raised the cost way up. Yeah so if you do bulkhead is cheaper I think that's why most people choose the bulk method of it because we need compared to any specific at cost way more than just throwing it at them. Yeah I'm good with with doing more general and not getting too targeted as long as we do the geographic thing. I agree like sometimes you you try to find people too much and I don't know that you're necessarily serving because he evolved like we said workout recovery is part of it that people come for relaxation they come to manage pain. They come to manage our brightest so there's lots of different ways they can enjoy the facility. So let's try to define them sometimes might be working against us a little bit. One thing that we ran into recently that it kind of led to us letting go of the previous provider was. They were too focused on cost for acquisition and in a feel like. Sometimes I realize that certain types of leads like they were talking specifically about Google search like if somebody searching for sauna. It was costing more than people we were getting in from meta but to me when somebody's searching for the services that we do that's that's a higher standard of client than somebody just finding it wanting to go try a thing. That's a little bit anecdotal but they literally quit running Google search ads because. They thought that they were getting cheaper results on meta and I just don't agree with that philosophy and I can see I see I doesn't agree with that either. They also told me we couldn't do targeted groups and one thing I did recently and I'm a total amateur so I'll say things in yuller more than welcome to correct me if it sounds wrong but. I went into it was specifically for YouTube because YouTube could just be all over the place but I was able to do geographic targeting and then I actually just asked chat GPT to create a list of. Biohacking influencers and search terms and the list based on my knowledge was really accurate and then I created a custom audience for people that have searched for those at any point so. If they've searched for some of these influencers they're going to know about what we don't do already so like I said that that hurdle of just people being aware of the things that we do and maybe how we're offering them. You already passed that if they're searching for Andrew Hubertman or Susan so bird. You don't need to know who those people are but I can give you the list so I created a custom audience and even with the geographic targeting it's still hundreds of thousands of people and now I can I'm currently serving. YouTube be adds to that group and again it's a small amount but it just feels. It feels a little bit more specific. So just wanted to share that. By the way my wife follows Andrew Hubertman a lot. One of his any of his hectic suit like becomes a piece beyond that matter. So yeah. Look information and everything. I just want to strike check to another topic just to know if they work the land or we land over there. Do you work with partners or channel partners or any coupon program for example maybe there's a saloon out there. Who has a banner or a leaflet that he if you buy our sin. We do set this together. We put for example for San Antonio. So is there anything to do partnership program or channel partnership program that he can. We can play. We should run your life. We've done a lot of partnerships that usually been very like in person where we've got we've got somebody on our team that physically goes to gems and places like that to get in front of their audience. I'm not sure if you're speaking about like digitally or in person. It person. It's actually a busy day works very well but since you are very vision. I said we it's going to be hard to find a digital partner. Most affected like a physical partner for example. You want to say go city market nearby. They're going to buy a coupon. Anybody who shops over 500 dollars. Yeah. Things like that. Right. We have thought about something like that. So we definitely thought about stuff like that right now. It's more referral agreements with nearby partners. We've got 20 plus partners that are very active and are sending us kind of a trickle for me to those places. Because it's slightly more involved to figure out how to get a. If you spend this much you get a coupon at wherever we've never really did. But. Dive in. That. That term is a. Tenses. And that kind of partnership yet but it's also because it's been so fruitful. On the lake from local business side. So far, even just going to their events and having them bring their audience to us has been really effective. And we're about to go to some apartment complexes and basically when somebody moves in they usually get a packet. So we're going to put it like a coupon in there like. You know free day pass. It's part of their move in because it's because then we can target that's a way to the way of partnering. So we're going to be a part of the way of partnering with Jay graphically. So yeah, those kind of ideas were we're definitely working on we call that gorilla marketing partnerships. The events we also do athletic events like if there's a race or a run or like this like yeah there was a 5k that we had two of our folks out on Saturday. They put on a table. They had you know, sauna hats and a couple things on there but the strategy it those just like it would be with apartments. This is the one time we do use free day passes. They've been incredibly effective in that in that specific use so they can refer people for free if it's their first visit. That usually works really well. Yeah, that team is actually outpaste our digital ads for about half action about a quarter of the cost. So if you guys can outpace them you. That that'll be the challenge. You're going to outpace our. Yeah, everyone. I'm very very very competitive. So in a fun way so if you can give us some like very specific ways we can measure that I think we'll it'll activate the good parts of our brain. Yeah, I think I think it may be as high as literally double so far. Yeah, the capacity for a quarter of the cost is the on on the ground real marketing stuff so we would love for that to change. Yeah, so yeah, that reminds me of a really important part of what we're trying to do is also like I know with both meta and Google where you've got Google meta tags or pixels where we want to track what a conversion is counted as. So for us an ideal conversion is a purchase of the day pass generally that half off offer. There are two strategies we have available. We can do a custom landing page where we've got one pull to action. It's a button that says purchase half off day pass which sends them to if you'll hear the term push press that's that's basically our CRM. So we'll talk about push press they have to make a purchase through push press and so on a point out push presses are pointed to sale. You know, as our CRM is not spec. Okay, yeah, I've heard push press call to CRM as well, but you want to know CRM they don't really manage leads and they don't really do outreach. So yeah, basically push press after somebody's been in the facility it's really good at managing members or people that have physically been to the space, but it did not do a good job of managing folks before they were in the facility as far as like a sales funnel type thing they didn't give us good tools. When we say, I'll expect that's generally referring to people before they've been into the facility and push presses after. So push presses where they have to physically make the purchase on the and we can do a. It's like a small landing page where they're just purchasing that one offer and we can make it say literally what they saw on the ad because we want to reflect what they're expecting. So the the big question we've had in the past is do we want them to go to a landing page where they have to click again to make the purchase. But they have the opportunity to learn more or do we want them to go straight to the purchase. We've seen a slight skewed toward better results when they go straight to the purchase page. There's just not a lot of data on there. So it may be a case where it depends on the ad set if we want them to engage more with content to learn more and then make the purchase or if we want to send them straight to the purchase page. We can also do a v testing there because so far it's been pretty clear but. So right. Yeah, I just popped into the chat. I won the radius from earlier, but to I just want to point out these are two pages side by side on. Like a little picture. Once the first visit day pass, it's had 973 views. The thank you page is people who've gone through the purchase and gotten to the confirmation page after purchase and that's like 65 right new unique views or 48 and the last 30 days. If we send them straight to push press where they where they purchase significantly more of those the ones that are getting to the thank you page confirmation at the end. If we send them to the first visit day pass or landing pages to purchase, you see the numbers that are really high there. They really don't they don't click three times. They'll click twice is definitely safe. But an a long time we need to capture those data. So what we can do is is, we can do that. We can just put benefits of the both world. We can have a bounce. We were in well while we will sit up. From the campaign user will click on a bounce or bounce and it will click two seconds. We redirect you to the post press. So that way we capture the data also we send you the to the post. You said the land page. The only tricky part is after the actual purchase. We were little bit limited on a. I'm creating you know a thank you page or a post purchase page. So what we've done is we've literally just put a button on there where it says. Click here to confirm and it's it's just making them manually send themselves to a thank you page. It's the best we can come up with because we can't. Basically and push press we we can't dictate that it goes to a different page. Am I explaining that right? Yeah, we we took of what I would call like a really dumb like low tech approach because their system just isn't that sophisticated. It wouldn't let us send to a like redirect but it would let us give a little message within a pop up set click here to confirm people do like 80% of the time click there to confirm. So yeah, let's give us pretty good data on that not great. So we can't get an email after the purchase like one thing that purchase it. Do you get an email like he's customer purchase. Yes, yes. We can work with the email once you got an email that's like the way that the. Oh, you need to send to thank you. That is so much better. I haven't thought about that. Yeah, that is that would be a direct like. Yeah, as long as yeah Google or met a wood and that could also help create a retireless. Okay, so we can also add them as admin specific person as admin Jeremy because it as admin you get those messages automatically. Like that's another another thing like that I mean you'll get all the messages all sales but you will get those messages every time. You can also direct purchase to go specifically to a specific person so email lives like. I would I would just try to push pixel somewhere like met a pixel or Google pixel where I can capture all the audience regardless of where they coming from. Yeah, so we may be bouncing what so bounce up page is basically a page where you don't see anything it just stays for one second and redirects you to the. Yeah, but the ones only capture all the news. Yeah, cool. We've tried either of those so thank you. Yeah. So that let me just give you the. The bad news is the all marketing and it's very badly that's the fact and I say knows this very well and I say literally. It tells me this every day like hey man marketing will die don't do. Of course. So there's a very good reason because every platform is coming up with AI I know you know, I go like today at tomorrow companies like our marketing services will be can make sting who knows because there are Yeah, we're in the platform making you guiding you to do what to do next right. That's another story. The reason I'm saying this marketing job needs to be evolved with the time. Whatever service or benefit we're going to bring you this month may not work next month. That's the sad part of it. But how much I how much this is my bringing to it just has to be evolved with the time that's what it is. And whatever strategy we do it has the time limit after certain time the strategy will not work. So capturing the data and storing it somewhere in a data being always good for us to ideate on bringing out new ideas. We can play so one platform's data can be used on other platform to target. For example, I get an email address. I'll go on YouTube and target them through the email address. You can come up with a lot of interesting ways to play with the data that he captured. Right. I love hearing that because that's what we've it seems like in the past we've had to change horses because they just they do one thing good in the next stick with it for a year and then just grind it down to where it doesn't work anymore. But they don't have to do. I told them I was like they were bringing us concerns but they weren't bringing a solution with it. So that's probably one of the things we'd ask is if you start seeing a problem with something's you know that's that's not working anymore. What's the next thing we're ready to pivot to and and I loved him or one of the big things that sold me as you said 20% of the budget should be testing the next thing. They were always responsive rather than being proactive. I love the proactive approach. I know that it costs money to do that but if we need that we've had kind of a roller coaster at times where you know we go from 80 feet in the door in a month to literally 20 a couple months later is what we saw. And you know it just it affects our you know obviously affects the business so we're just looking for more consistency and you know driving the cost that would be great but. But we're also trying to find what is the. What is the point of diminishing returns like I'm as long as we continue to see traffic in the door. I'm I'm totally eager to increase our ads been but we feel like sometimes we've overspent where we're not seeing as much traffic and we just need to be aware that because at the end of the day to still an expense. And if we're just pushing too hard to to overspend but we're really not seeing extra traffic from that. We kind of like to try and figure out where that point of diminishing returns are so we can. If you'll ask me for a budget I'll give you a budget but really we'd like to understand you know what is the point where the cost of getting someone in his twice. What it normally is or something like that. If he's a. If he's about traffic if you say like hey my name I mean traffic I can send you traffic traffic is there a problem but probably traffic has to convert. Yes, right. He's easy to get traffic by the way you can just. Yeah, I don't know where you will get a lot of traffic and we don't want to be a company or a team like that that's to. So, you can send you the wrong traffic. So the whole idea should be like if you get a traffic. If you have 2.5% conversion that is a very good conversion average conversion is 1.2 1.7. So out of like. 100 people want to people might to go out in the middle that's the real number. Let's say we can actually like 2.5% or 3% conversion we're literally doing the right thing. We would be that thing. So I'm I'm going to be very skeptic on deciding where to find the right type of traffic instead of just looking for the traffic. Sure. Let's take a look at your. Add the count. Okay, we're going to start with Google or meta. Let's start with Google. Okay. I'm going to screen share. I'm probably already logged in because I've been goofing around with it. So y'all are welcome to laugh or. To Joel as you please. I created a few of these because I don't know sometimes I just want to. Understand how these things work so we can have more educated conversations but. We're going to the last 30 days so basically. On the. The seventh of this month is when I kind of discovered there were some things not not happening in Google. So I went in and just started creating stuff. So all this craziness you see over here was Jeremy's ads. I mean it looks mostly very positive you know. I'll get rid of some of these. You know I was able to really. I don't know if conversions is accurate but you know I got a lot. I got a lot. You as the business owner immediately made a difference. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I mean we've seen we've seen actual purchases happen and that's what I told them. I was like I was a total amateur and. I was able to go in here and do some stuff and so one thing I've done. So this is really funny so if we go to red light in San Antonio. Hey no traffic people are just not searching for it. If I do the same thing in Dallas they're getting a ton of traffic on red light. It's really funny. Um. So Ana is obviously getting a lot more traffic. Um, but it's still that's that's not a lot of clicks for. Um, traffic. Uh, again these are very new ads so I don't know if there's a better way to do that but I'm basically just. You know they weren't doing anything specific so these are the search terms that are showing up. Um. But I'm not sure if there's a better way to do that. Um, I just started doing these. Uh, YouTube ads. Again, I don't think we obviously haven't had 50 purchases so there's something going wrong with conversions. Um, I'm giving these all. Uh, these are all text based UG ads. Um, I'm generally going to have um, there's a video going with it. Um, and it's it's really not that's the other thing is we need. We need some content that actually works on YouTube. I don't know much about it. I just did some of the videos that we had. And again it was just to kind of start testing. I didn't really expect much from it. They've had good success with. This is kind of specific to cold plunge, but what I did is I went in and fix the geographic area and fix some of the terms that they were using. Um, and just. What I also ran into was they were using really weird. Um, terminology and phrases in these ads. You know when you build them, you've got your headline and then you're all that stuff. And they did that. Like it was like, yeah, things click for one thing, which is why I created. You know, we're not going to get a lot of traffic from it, but I was like, if somebody searches for red light and then the ads is cold plunge, they're not going to click on it. Um, or our conversions going to be really poor. So the reason I created these categories is so that at least it may don't be a lot of traffic, but at least if they're searching for something, they're going to see in it ad and pictures that relate to it. So that's what I was trying to do again, we're we're getting really poor traffic, but we're getting better conversion rates. Um, and I was actually trying to reduce. They were getting most of our traffic from people searching for evil. You all human optimization lab. So people searching for our name and they were calling that a win. I don't know me personally. It's the only search for it. It had the right. It is literally the only one. It was the old. It was really the only search term they were and they were like really patent themselves on the market. They were getting conversions from people that were searching for our name. I'm like, that was we're already going to show up organically number one. So I just spent money to capture somebody that already knew about us. So I just personally don't think that serving an ad for our name makes any sense unless a competitor is doing it maybe, but I don't think that's happening. By the way, I do have a competitor. Ad set going. I don't think it's performing very well. So yeah, we're getting a little bit. I only kind of focus on the bigger names. I don't know. I got a personal vendetta against float essay. We're going to take those people down. I did want to turn off. I actually had to create a negative keyword for our other business. Because I think we that was actually showing up in here. But no, I can give you all a list of this businesses that do the same thing as us. And as I don't know, some people might think it's sketchy. I think it's just business, you know, like we're competing for. So I'm absolutely the biggest of the best to do it to. I mean, the way I look at this is like, okay, so these guys specifically we're going after them because they were members. And then they just happened to start have some of our services at their facility. So they're the ones I'm really going after. But hey, 26 of their customers know about us now. So these are all the terms that it's showing for. But I can get you actually the list and there's pretty good. So I don't need to send all this. But yeah, like these terms in the past, they were just the wording. Just you could tell that it was somebody outside the industry doing it. So if you all need me to create any of this stuff, I would rather provide it for y'all than trying to do that. I'm like, what does that mean, man? So yeah, it's just, again, just so many terms that weren't relevant to what people were searching for. Yeah, really confusing. So what would you like to see in here? Amran, is there anything you want me to click on her? I think it's good on the real business, but there should be a lot more water. We have to be a lot more work, putting to choosing the ads itself. Like the headline should be based on all services. So yeah, for example, if somebody search for some or the headline should be telling something about some. I'm not like a generic headline. So these type of continuity needs some work to be set up. So I see this is good as a generalist, but you have to put some time into it to sitting up and do some connectivity to the keyword. There is a secret, is it? Is it? Is it the headline doesn't say exactly what the keyword was? That would be a miscellaneous to people. Oh, by the way, this was an accident. I clicked on the wrong thing, but this is where they would make the purchase. So currently the ads that are showing persona, they would see that the words were discussing. And then if they click on the purchase, it would go here. So this is what they can see. Wow. Unfortunately, this is so that we know where it came from. But I don't think it's a negative thing, but they can see, you know, we can fill in this script. We can change this. So, but it's not in a very sexy. Is there any way for us to put, like below that, like at least like a map location or click for directions or something? So the person's like, well, I don't know how close this is can easily check. I don't think so. But we can certainly look. Yeah, this is basically like a landing page that push press creates and this field, the highlighted we can we can change. And then they have to click on more info, but we can put in text here. But that's a good point. So we've got like, when we're open. You know, but we can put more information in here. I'm not sure how helpful that'll be. Hi. I don't think the information here is a problem. The information is fine. People are just going to click by, but the main barrier would be not being able to track it. So if you could track it. So I see why you have done it. You're just, you know, like, this is the one way to see. Separate, take out page, you created to make sure. Transstand where things are came from. That's a nice hack. But ideally there should be a bit of a way to do it. Right. So to your point. Oops. That kicked me out here. Um, so this is for sauna. And so just kind of showing you all. So this is where that URL goes to that plan. Um, I actually, I don't know what to do here. So I'll show you all this stuff that I didn't touch. I put into these terms. You just want to point out Jeremy. We do actually have. Fifty sales right now showing for San Antonio. So that from the ninth. I know that you're saying 50 conversions. Like, I don't know if we actually do. Yep. Fifty sales right now. That's really good for the month. That's right. Good. Seven to most please. I'm sorry for me. All was the highest number. I think we saw from you all was in the 70s. So for already at 50, I am way out performing them, which is really sad because I'm no good at this. But yeah, these descriptions. Um, I try and make them. Interesting. Like, we are the unspawn services you want without the appointments. And shut up. I'm just trying different things. Some of them are, but they're all at least. I think relevant. And then. Um, images. I can get you all more. But since this at a specific to sauna, these are all kind of sauna. And red light images. Um, so I just kind of have those in there. Um. When it this stuff, I get really confused by. I don't know. I don't have any of this stuff really filled out other than, you know, the full number. Um, so there's there's probably a lot more detail that can go in. We've got a few sight links. I don't even really know where those show up. So again, just, uh, I'm confused why this is showing up here though. I don't know if that's just because we have both accounts. The location was given in. I have one question. I wrote the first example. Imagine you clicked on the checkout button. You landed on the push, push press website like this page. Um, didn't follow too. Okay. Do you see how many people didn't follow through? I don't think when they go to this one. If it was a landing page, we could, but with this, I don't believe we have that data. Unfortunately. Yeah. And the magic of it, the real magic, the word Amazon and the big companies kind of shine is to track you down. And NAU wants you to check out and be in the pharmaceutical phase. So there's where all the equals company like if you go into a shoe, check out phase and don't buy the shoe. Like I, they're going to bother you for 30 days. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's something up like this. Remember the bouncing page, the bounce page I mentioned. If you have a bounce and don't include the push press URL, you're going to push a special URL. And whenever somebody kicks and check out, they will land on this special page. And then we'll do it to push this. Now, this way, we'll, we'll have a pixel. Maybe you can find a way if the person actually checked out on our part. And that is still, there's still a missing part. Yeah. I'm going to connect the user. Can we, by the way, can we, I'm just asking, I don't know how much you know about push press. Is there any way we can send a random number or a reference number on a push press that can be found in the checkout. Like if you go to the push press website again. Go on this, go on the push press. Oh, yeah, sorry. Yeah. So, you might, you might, is there a random number I can pass for them? Look at the URL page. Line, landing slash, plan slash, plan and risk code. Oh, right here. If I have a random number, then I can give a random number to every busy. That way, I can track if that person actually checked out on one. That's anything that would help me to tie the traffic to the conversion. That we can see as much as I would like to. This is the thing we've been hitting our head against since we owe. Yeah, like no, I don't think we can. It's something push press allows us very, very little that we can change. Unfortunately, the thing, I'll be very advanced. But I'll show you all the alternatives. So this is Dallas is so if we wanted to. Again, I don't know how much the difference was between going directly to the purchase page versus the landing page. But there is large. Yeah. Was it that page? It was the difference between us getting. Very few sales and a lot of sales. The biggest change you made between what they did before and what you did now, Honestly, is you sending it straight to the conversion page. Everything was going to landing pages last month, that's when we got 17 sales. I don't even know that the app. That's a change that much, right? It. It. One month's another. I would like you guys to test it anyways because again, Y'all on the data side was very, very poor. So there could be something we, you know, There was happening on the back end that was affecting that. But, you know, if they click here, they end up back at the purchase page. The most common issue with people bailing out from a landing page, It'd be like if somebody clicked on the ad, then landed on a page, which does not represent the same branding. They would feel like they might be. The only reason the most probable reason people bailing out is with you. People with the same branding are these stealing make-they can or am I checking out? Right. We could also, as far as I understand, it's easy for high-room to create more landing pages. So we could also create landing pages that reflect the ads more closely. This is basically kind of educating them on what it is. But again, this picture ideally, if it's a sauna ad, this picture would show somebody in a sauna. That's the kind of stuff that may have been affecting our purchase rates to your point. And we're on if they weren't seeing an ad that directly affects, Or I'm sorry, landing page that directly reflects the ad. Maybe that's part of where we're getting a disconnect. And I think to one of the things, I know this is an exactly what this meaning is about. One of the things you'll talk about is how much better it would be if you all may throw landing pages, So that you could reflect those kind of changes and stuff like that. And I do see how that could be super useful. Because I can duplicate a landing page. I can change out a picture. There's still not a lot of data behind it. So there is some limitation there. But if we, to save the time for y'all on the landing pages, if you, and again, something I haven't mentioned is we do, you know, 20 different things that evolve. I always talk about like there's there's basically like five that people might actually be searching for or that have like a broader awareness. Sonna is is very high on the list. Red light therapy actually did a, I went in and Google will tell you how many people are searching for certain terms. Red light actually surpassed Sonna recently. So it's a big topic of conversation. And we're on to your point. Um, Cubaman has done an entire episode on red light therapy or light therapy. So red light. Sonna's and we do both types of Sonna's traditional and infrared. That can be kind of confusing for people outside the industry, but they're, they're two different services and they, they work differently. And it's actually a strategic advantage. I don't know of any other facilities, especially franchises that have a traditional and infrared son on both. We never try running ads to that effect, but so red light Sonna's cold plunge. And then compressions leaves a little bit. I don't know that people are really seeking out a place to go and do compression sleeves. They greatly enjoy it. But I don't know if it's really a big search term. I feel like I'm forgetting something. The massage chairs are very popular, but I don't think people again, if they're searching for massage chairs, they probably want to buy one. I don't know that they're looking for a place to go and do a massage chair. So out of all the different categories we could run ads for, it's really just those, those three. That I think we will get searches for, which is why I have, you know, three ad groups that are basically red light, Sonna cold plunge. This gets into our competitor and I'm not sure what this branding one is. I think this is. Oh, yeah, this is this is kind of like a little bit of everything. And then YouTube is where I created. I don't know if it would be interested in this. But the group I created. I will always show us time on it. Oh, audiences, that's really nice. And then I don't want to this shows. Lifestyle, the move. Oh, yeah, biohacker. So this is the custom list that I created. 10 to 50 million. I think that's for the United States, but then we geographically target it as well. Anyway, what else, what other questions do you all have, or do we want to switch to meta? Yeah, I think let's switch to meta. And I guess I don't remember where you're going to access. So if you want to while you're in their grant us accesses. That's good idea. Yeah, I'm going to be the other thing. I really hate that you have to go through your own profile for this. I think it's so silly. It's ridiculous. And I haven't played with these, but it does seem like they've gotten a lot more sophisticated in meta. You know, you've got a lot of different ad groups. So if this has tests or Ricky, those are employees. We're actually testing out running meta ads through their account, so that it doesn't look as much like a net and it's kind of like a personal touch. So far, they were trending pretty well. But this just launched very recently. So. Okay, so let's see, I've done this. Man, they make it challenging on getting your access. Hmm, so these are the folks who've got in here. Y'all actually need to kick out pretty soon. Let's see if it partners. This is where you'll need to be added in. So. These guys show up because. So if you all have an ad account with an ID number, that makes it a lot easier. Because I can assign an asset to that ID. Otherwise, we can use email and kind of like like, manny with alt. We're using his email address, but it doesn't seem to work as well when you'll accept when you're on that. We have an ad account right. I met a business account. Yeah, we have a business. I'm sure. We have not by the way, we have not posted any ad for our work yet. Oh, assign assets. That's where it is. So I can just select both. Where do we have to plan to plan for the first time? Where do we have to plan to plan for the first time? I'm going to do that. There we are. I've given my email address there. If you can invite me on this, I will invite everybody else on the. Yeah, on zoom. We try that. We're going to say, what do you want to assign to? Let's try. I think I'd like your days. I'm going to say that. Let's try. Let's try this. I'll see what happens. I'll see if I can find the link. But Travis had a company who's working with where they walk the user through this ad on process and it worked really good. I've been working with the company. It tells you where to click and give you the information from the ad agency for it. I would have to invite my team with this. I says, I may need to ask you to give me more access. It needed later. There's one. It was giving me the. I think it's going to be a good idea. I think it's going to be a good idea. I think it's going to be a good idea. I was able to, I was able to do that for these guys. I should just go ahead and kick them out. Right. I think so. Yeah, there's literally no reason to keep it. And they're not working on. I'll just gruntled they are. Man he's OK. He's with all. Let's try this. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to try that. Nope. And then sometimes meta just doesn't work. Sorry, you're a civilian messaging me. Go into the chat. Oh, no. It's just stuff. I'm going to use. Oh. There we go. Let's try that. There we go. Maybe that's it. Oops. That was Dallas. Oops. Well, hopefully, I'm sure Dallas will be on board soon. So you already have access. This is where I would like to get you guys, but that's where I need that ID. So I think that is better access, but it doesn't let you type in. You have to have the ID for this section, which is why y'all's in there. It's actually this remove access. I don't want them to see what y'all are doing. That's your info. Ajay, may I paste it an ID? Zoom. Can you try this? Ah, yes. Thank you. Got it. Coffee. Let's try that. Purple. See, is this our assistant's ID? Eight for? Yes, why did this is the business ID? I mean, you can paste it. Paste it to the assigned partner. Go to the assigned partner. Yes. Now we have to paste it. Yeah. I'll do that first. Let me see. There we go. I've been in it. Hey. I'm right. Make sure that looks like you have full access. That should do it. Yep. It looks like it. This is my cool. Have fun. That's a mess in there. I don't understand that at all. For some reason Google seems a lot simpler to me. This is like a complex. It's not just you. The whole one. It's maybe. The whole one. It's meta. Yeah, that's a. That's pretty true in general. Okay. Just for everything. Maybe we can only. We got hacked in 2023 or no 2021. And it took us three months to get back in there. It was a nightmare. You can't get a hold of a person. Okay. So for this, I want to get you guys in. Okay. I'm sure it's admin. Access and security. Okay. I see your pages. Thank you. Mm-hm. Let me come from again. I see. I see you. I see you. Sorry. I don't see your pages yet. Uh, I see. Do you see? I think I think we don't get the. The page access. Okay. Yeah. Jamie, would you mind going to the assets and allow us access? Can't think. Mm-hm. Do you have a question? You can go back on. You can go back on. You can go back on. Now you can go back to the assets. Individus. Ah. Okay. Jamie, you can go to the pages and then. Ah. Yeah. Gotcha. Thanks, Cecil. Oh, sorry. I'll miss. Uh, you just add business. I need to add business. I just added business. I need to add business. Yes. You just set a tab partner. Ah. There we go. Uh, but what is the partner here? No, it's a different. Maybe it's just the best. Sorry. I'm sure moving these guys will be here. I think that's the same way. Yeah. Just see. I think that's a partner. I think that's not a bad tidy. Excuse me. Oh, sorry. I didn't see that. Okay. Gotcha. Nice. You're going to add a counter there. I can't do that. I think that one. Nope. You're going to do it. Okay. Take on the partner steps. We are already. Yeah. I don't see it. I see. Oh, it says. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't see it. I don't see it. Oh, it says. Yeah. Yeah. I don't see it. I don't see it. I don't see it. Oh, it says. Yeah. Just click on the partner step. Oh, sorry. Yeah. No. Oh, I got it. Congratulations. Thanks. I agree. Jeremy, you also have pixel, right? So my need to the pixel. So Jeremy, there's a Facebook has a lot of products. 38 products. So as a partner, you have to allow us access to each of them. Whatever you want to work as a, you know, you want us to work. So this is an interior. Yeah. There's. Okay. Hmm. In the data set. Oh, we just, it is in the data set. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Here's the pixel. I'm just going to. I'm just reading these as we go. So did you try to install pixel in the push press, too? Push press. I think it's a sign in the landing page, but I don't think push press will allow us to change any code. There you are. Oh, um, I don't know what this is. Uh, they're representing data to your Facebook. I mean, push press probably has a Facebook integration that pushing. See, I'm going to hear. We have to see the data set there pushing. Yeah. Put you all in there. We'll see what happens. I'm not sure. You can also like, I drew the press press. Yeah. Okay. This could mean we can target push press people. They must have some sort of connectivity with Facebook or whatever. We'll see. They're sending data. Yeah. This is me. Okay. That's all good. Um, anywhere else that they sneak to the. Uh, the Instagram account. Can you check there? Uh, yeah. Oh, there we go. Great. Yeah. Oh, there we go. Great. Yeah. The web of madam. So you don't use WhatsApp by NHS, right? No, WhatsApp. No, not yet. And I haven't. No. If people do ads, you just have, just run out of curiosity. Is WhatsApp a good business model because here in Asia, WhatsApp is literally OK. Nothing sales more. So on your side, are you guys not, do you guys use WhatsApp that much or does business that do the stay away from WhatsApp? It. And stay away from it. Like I'm on it. That's like our like more like a text chain for like the thousands of students to. So, too. I don't think anybody like is super trusting WhatsApp on the business side here. I've only used it for like international calling or texting. But not not local. Pretty common in the USA guys is. Most people I know don't have WhatsApp unless they go on an international show. Yeah. That's that's very interesting because that is what there is a US product, but most of his customers are our ideas. Yes. Yeah. That's cool. We just need to be fixed. Um, think this is OK. We can get the other one. I see. Do you have access to ads and pixels everything? I get you. Learn. Learn. Thank you. Jenny, I'm putting my email address here for Google apps. This is my email address for Google apps. If you want to invite me. OK, let me see. Got it. It's not. Oops. Is that right? Yeah. I'm giving you another minute. Just a two. Oh, I get to fix that. Let me see. That was. I saw this the other day. We've only got certain domains that are. I think that might be an our general account. So, so what I can see in our business portfolio. So I can see we're reading the events from Ebola view, my left's big zeldeta set, but not from push press. No problem. Push press is a different problem. We'll figure it out later. OK. Thank you. There's somewhere in here where maybe it's here. We've got a list of domains that are accepted. Jamie, do you mind if I guide you? Sure. No, I'd love that. Thank you. OK, let's go to the previous page, access and security. So click on the security tab. Ah, thank you. That's it. Just allow the can't sync domain and VNPZ domain. Let me type domain here. Would that be right? Yeah. Perfect. Let me give you another domain. Green-out studio. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. It's not. it's not just a Zoom chat-tefl Rh majority area coffee. Thank you. Ok. of the women or more friendly also a see who is that man. Yeah. All of them have been. Oh. Hmm. Yeah. I'm sure there's an admin. Interesting. Yeah. And you're not invited by anybody either right here. Yeah. Oh yeah. That's probably a workspace setting. Yes. I have bad things. I have a meeting on this during the interview. Yes. It's probably not here, Jeremy. This is your personal settings. Hmm. Okay. You want to, if you send me an email on it, we can jump off. So. Yeah. Yeah. It's probably not here, Jeremy. This is your personal settings. Hmm. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So here's what we're going to do. Thank you. It was a great start. Chase. And I'm on in our sear. Let's collect what we saw today and some of those ideas. And I've just the growth of the bets forward. A little bit for tomorrow to make sure we're really nailing the ads first. And then we get another.

 play. I sure do. My play quite a bit actually. I was in some bands here in Austin that got wrecked from COVID, but now I still play with my daughter and we'll do gigs here in there being whatever in orchestra rock band you know. That's awesome man. That's awesome. Yeah, I played for I don't know, 30, 40 years early on you should manage bands and started being in bands and got tired of being tired. But one of my kind of retirement goals when we traveled my wife and I both travel for fun and I like to get to know people in places not just kind of be voristic when I tour. So I thought you know it was in center of paint last year and I thought you know when we were tired I wanted to just do acoustic sets you know you know like we say in center pay for a few weeks play a couple gigs man get to know locals get to know the travels just for a bottle of wine that's all we need you know me just as kind of a fun thing to do so I've been helping my game kind of get back into performance mode and also taking that vocal lessons every week I can I can carry a tune but I figured you know I got four more years before kind of ready to get to that phase four years of lessons in practice I want to be just surprisingly good I want people to go that's better than I thought it was going to be so that's my goal hurt I love this okay this is great because you know Jeremy and higher and play oh yeah as well we need to get ourselves a set list for the next together that's Jeremy you have Jeremy I have a drum set right over here yeah so Jeremy's yeah when we first started getting things set up up here he would come and and he is a good solid drummer man he's he's fun to play with I my understanding is he was going to be a pro for a while yeah he certainly has a chops and we we're pulling at like Arctic monkeys and some other songs that just have some very intense you know not your basic drum kit you type of performance he's he's he's a star for sure right on okay well I can't wait to play with those guys and yeah your retirement idea sounds incredible I took my I took a plastic trumpet to Bangladesh two times now people thought it was the craziest thing but it's not as it's not as inviting as a guitar and singing so love that plan yeah now you gotta change it up man it's always fun so how's your plan going how things going with you guys anyway just on the side note oh they're they're okay the main thing that is causing me outrageous amounts of heartburn is the build process our architect is just wildly behind schedule oh behind schedule and I am a complete rookie at brick and mortar yeah all my businesses are digital and you know corporate so we're actually looking this month at because the SBA loan the they they unlock the small amount of the deposit but we actually can't unlock the vast majority of funds until permits on file with the city right permits can't be on file until and so there's all these and we're just waiting on this one things to salmon are going crazy right now because everything else is like doing well we've got all these takeover scheduled we've got a lot of interest and it's just not moving and our bank account is suddenly empty so I could find something else for salmon to do for a month or so while we just wait so other than that is great but that really sucks yeah no that that's a tough one man you know I another retail company I had for a long time is American pario bit I had I created that and then I franchiseed before I sold it so I've gotten to do some brick and mortar so I've had you know over a decade of experience in brick and mortar is and most of those gigs I did my you know I'd GC it myself is all fucking duct tape and stuff because we do have the funds to do it right this time you know I got extremely well known GC and Dallas I mean this guy is so much pool we had we got our we got our green tag our CO without power because the inspectors knew the GC and was like oh you know if he did it it's good I mean I'd never run into anything like it so just going forward man I probably paid 15% more maybe 20% more for the whole project but he his architect just rock solid he's rock solid and I'll tell you the other thing that I've been really surprised at over the last year a couple things have come up and whatnot I call him he gets you know there's AC issue the owner of the AC sub you know the subcon contractor the owner comes out that day that afternoon to deal with my issue another thing I'd get something kind of rewired no charges his people were on it so as you get to multiple occasions if this one goes well if I could go back in time and say hey Kurt go ahead and don't look for the cheapest get someone who has some juice with the city it was game changer for me no kidding so highly recommend and he does work in a he does work in Austin so next time we should have talked three months ago yeah that's a bomb yeah so anyway I'm excited for you guys to grow up you know the the water rises all boats and I'm hoping that that's going to be in full effect as you know as you guys start to hit market and that kind of stuff as well I think so too yeah exactly I just the demand for this kind of thing is increasing so much we want people to really adopt what's innovative about the model and you know the playground aspect of it and lack of appointments I think it's huge and in here in George Townsend I'm in North Austin there are at least three different places now that are like under construction or something but in the suffer from those same problems it's like we do just cryo and redlight therapy and their appointments and I'm talking to people I was like yeah it's $200 every time I walk in there like oh yeah so yeah the the model is brilliant another side story the first a year ago year little over a year ago I'm coming back after you know a long day of takeovers on a Saturday and you know I'm still you know we just we put a half million in right so we're still in that a little bit anxiety and I sit down and watch in a Sarah at live just to relax before I go to bed and Josh Brolin comes out does his monologue at the end of his monologue he cold punches like they drag and cold punch out and I'm like I thought I thought it was hallucinating at the time and I'm like okay so the time is good but but you're right the model you know we have the two two players coming into our spades and to Dallas right now Dallas sawna house and one other guy and you know they they got the big three the cold plunge the sauna and the red light but again the same old tired model that you know and I look at it this way it's it's really they aren't even competition because if people want a spa experience where I'm setting up their towels and giving them cucumber water then go to these other places because that's not us if you know and and we can't compete with that on the other hand if they want to open model and come whenever they want and pay a lot less then that's our model and they can't compete with us so look it's market awareness I'm you know I'm I'm preaching to an expert but I think you know the model I think will hold out really really well now I do worry when big money comes in and comes in with the model like ours but hopefully we're gonna get our elbows out enough to where you know they're gonna do it in some of the part of the country because they're gonna do it here because we own Dallas for Austin or Texas. Let's go cool good well let let me let let me let me show you a couple things that I think you'll find interesting and then see where that leads us okay so go over here the reason that we are talking is because we just started taking on growth marketing for evolve San Antonio and I just been doing it for ourselves you know the whole time but I wanted you to just kind of get a sense of how we work I run an anti bureaucracy shop I've done a lot of turn around and different things and so what we do is once a week we sit down and plan one of these columns which we call a growth sprint and our team executes that growth sprint and we kind of t-shirt sizes a small medium large extra large with these things story points so one point is small two points is actually one point is extra small two points is small you know three point is big like this and so what we do is things like all right let's create a sauna landing page and video sales letter this week get it done and ship it and make it have results next week we want to ab test um this one landing page that we just created versus push press the ticket system and see which one converts better because we have a hypothesis that the landing page is going to convert better right week after that we do xyz and so this growth bet model is something that I sort of built by leading product teams and turning it into the growth world and Jeremy's found that to be attracted because a lot of brand marketers tend to focus a little too much on pictures and how beautiful something is as if that's the finish line as opposed to the result and right um that's really the main thing so as we look at a couple of other things because you mentioned travel I wanted to show you this this is one of our other um ones we just made where uh inron he's on the phone here he's one of my business partners he and I designed and built this travel app for a client and we've just started deploying this as their marketing and built uh there's a nice video here and built their web pages and stuff but uh we know that this is just like having a business card it doesn't actually need the business right and so uh what else do you do we build these funnels for the full ecosystem of how are you getting awareness in the first place acquiring those customers activating them and then uh you know retention marketing right and each of these funnels is 100% custom to the situation so our evolve uh Dallas I mean not Dallas or evolve Austin journeys right now we're all top of funnel focused because it's a brand new outlet where as a person no one you is actually some top of funnel but more acquisition focused um and so that's really it um I don't know if you've seen any of the work yeah I would be the visual stuff you know good videos that kind of things so Jeremy thought interested in taking a peek and that's all I know that's the one we're here right on now it looks good and um I mean look as to me the the metrics is how many new people are coming in um you know the conversion the the ability to convert you know often happens in the in the lab and that's obviously comes to a lot of the sales training and our own staff again you know there you certainly can convert online I mean that's great too and I know with right now with Jeremy we're really focused on retention because again you I mean I have to explain to you the cost of you know getting a new one versus keeping one you want to just keep the ones you have push best did did just come out with some uh and I'm not sure if you got to see it yet but the commitment club is kind of where you can get streaks and that type of stuff that that has been lacking and they just launched that last week so I'm I'm kicking the tires on that to see how that's going to work that should certainly help reduce the churn because that has been one of the surprises is the churn when you dive into the numbers it's lack of utilization lack of priorities and that type of stuff and that comes into an education piece for us but I have noticed with y'all who have fairly good success early on you know when I start to look at the new visitor rates they're they're diminishing quickly so you know I know mainly I don't really do social medium trying to get back on it I've a love hate thing with it but my wife is on it fairly consistently she's seen the same ads over and over again and that you know repetition works to a point and then it becomes really inefficient so I'm hoping going with you guys we get back to that you know the goal and look I you know we need to see at least a hundred visitors new visitors per month for location to get it and then you know my job on that is to get at least a 25% or higher conversion rate for that I'd like to be closer to one fifty to two hundred honestly new visitors in a month and that way I can you know we that 25 or thirty 35% conversion rate will keep us at a healthy growth so that's that's kind of what I'm looking for obviously there's a little bit bigger spend with you guys and I know you guys do the content creation so I guess one I wanted to get your to take on on my expected returns that I just kind of gave you and two is we do have a really good one of our lab tech is great at social media and and she's you know we're paying like ten bucks a post so she's very cost effective as well and even get a Jeremy's like man a lot of time your social media posting is better than ours so question one my metrics and expectations too since we do have a built in solid content you can tell me after looking at our content that she does a good job is that something we could still utilize with you guys or or you know is it a replaceable thing is more better what's your thoughts on that thank you so we would not want to replace something that's working our job is to come and take bad to good or non-existent to exist and so we have a full range of services that we do I think we have a menu that may have sent it to you actually hold on I'll grab it here you go so the way that we look at this stuff is just there are activities that drive the results and we have to keep our eye on the ball on all of them this is a non-exhaustive list of the types of things that we'll do so we might we meet with you once a week to decide so if you did have a week where you're like oh no she I don't know got sick for two weeks and we're behind on two weeks we'd just be like okay great let's slot some story points towards social media post creation but outside of that we're gonna probably mostly focus on other types of things like especially if you're wanting you know top of funnel focus then we're gonna probably especially focus hard on ads and then on content marketing right like what kind of very serious top of funnel educational piece have you got that's got people downloading and giving you their contact info so that you can nurture them towards close so I think I would like to have Imron share his screen for a second if you don't mind showing some of what we found in the way that San Antonio is doing ad spend what we're worried about in a way that's probably good for us but bad for you is that if y'all also ran some of your ads it's pretty pretty messed up and there's a way to be a lot more efficient with that so I'll let you go for a second yeah you've all y'all's had our ads for like the last year so I didn't touch that at all so yeah now I'm very curious your analysis okay and once he's done I'll tell you one more thing go basically what we saw is that the most of the ads are kind of like I'm just gonna be like proud flood using this small word empty US in a way in a way because if you just look at this number I don't know if you can see my screen yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so these are real numbers we took from from their ads account and uh it you can't see the like these they have the spend a lot of money and the cost is quite high and generally if you're very these are like a really high conversion rate as you can see it's like sure because we saw those more ads were not properly set up but uh on a general level whenever you put money into ads it needs to be properly set up and properly delivered just to make sure the return of the investment or or the value you're trying to get properly I think and we do see like they're trying to they have made improvement over the over the following months like may or June you see this is just spending less also the the conversion rate very very high because they probably have improved few of the this is just a nature of how they're spending and I'm just gonna say like their Facebook ads are especially a little bit out of control and they are yeah they're not referring to this spend like $2,000 a month as you can see this is like quite high cpm rate and kicker this that's also cost per purchase is very high because those ads were not properly reached to the right customer you're not a way of example I'm an often and I got your Dallas Evolvads I was like what is this doing here yeah that's terrible the way we would the prioritizes make it very hyper localization is kind of like really hyper so yeah a lot of the final budget that you're planning for ads also the personalization kind of gives you more focused and more the more localized view from each ad and whatever the campaign method is can be awareness it can be about sales or can be about just booking you get accurate result from each ads at spending the way we're trying to solve or improve as it is to improve up on their the extinct strategy and we have already made some ads plan that's gonna go out this week and our goal is to first create a setup with our owners then try to close and create an audience level on hyper localized strategy that's how we we are probably I'm highly hopeful I'm gonna be too optimistic at analysts we see results after running few months but it's getting much better than what they're previously I've been seeing excellent what kind of radius in Austin are you working it to do I mean Dallas has even a little bit more dense but what what what mile radius or you you consider optimal in Austin because we're in suburbs we're in the 15 mile radius whereas if I was a little closer to downtown I would be in more the 10 mile radius yeah even in Dallas particularly in our neighborhood setting I'm not sure for how from a year or a with Dallas yeah five to 97 might be might be might be where it's at if you can kind of if you can get it whittle it down that much because over 10 miles is you know is another is another city in some ways in our little area so again and we can also play with that as we go forward will you do kind of the analysis of what they've done here or do you just move forward normally we do this do the analysis and or it first just get our knowledge ahead but actually not what you're completely on anything or finding just for our own understanding of how things been so we can make the change accordingly one of the like about location is that radius is one thing but when you throw an air it's not just about radius you get to play with other attributes and factors like the business location the the world you're gonna office and race or the names or you know the ethnicity or the people or their behavior let's say we're not target people who has a path day to day things like that see right on you get to clean with a lot of stuff if you do have time to explore is not just always about location the in California is was we're targeting some of the businesses and organizations that are around us so in in roundrock specifically Dell headquarters is right there about a mile so it'll be right so we're working hard on how do we target those employees and I wonder I don't actually know my Dallas geography that well but I know you know some mega corporations are for sure headquarters there I'm wondering what are in close distance for you yeah and I can do we don't all the hubs like Toyota and that type of stuff are all kind of in the sub of area we're kind of in the thick of it but like SMU is right across the street and you know we've a hard time kind of penetrating we'll get in with the sorority and then we can tell it will spread out we'll get a good chunk of them the the problem with that the the challenges then they leave for the summer and then we have to do it again the next year so there'll be some targets on that type of thing which I'm happy to start funneling as we meet on a weekly basis I can all you know keep kind of guiding you and give me a little bit more insight to what I think might be helpful here well cool well I mean again I

 And currently between San Antonio and Dallas, we actually pay into it too, because we feel like that's more fair. We should feel that. And we sequester that money to make sure that it's only used to benefit franchisees. So currently it's San Antonio and Dallas, obviously round rock hasn't paid into it yet. But there's some funds in there and we actually would like to spend it, but we want to be very careful that it's something that benefits both San Antonio and Dallas at this time. And then once round rock has part of that. So if there's a project that we could push forward, that would benefit both locations, either in creating, you know, we could fast-paced creating landing pages that could be used for either or it gets tricky with ad budget, like we don't spend it typically directly on ad budget, because that's kind of like separate. But if there's a project that can benefit everybody as a whole, we can put some funds toward that and fast-paced, which is one of the things I love about how you guys operate the point system. So basically I'm saying, like, if there's anything that's, if you guys have the bandwidth or something that we can fast-paced, that will allow us to make San Antonio and Dallas's adds more effective or tools that you guys would need, we can put extra funds toward that separate from the money that each location is paying for. That's a very useful time now. Because there's an only RR here, that comes online. And I don't know how to work, because it wasn't a collaboration, especially because you guys all operate on the same domain. So it's hard to turn one person for something that just helps everyone with the domain. So that's actually very useful to know. So we'll come up with a couple of ideas for that specifically. And that could also, I mean, we've been relatively happy with Squarespace. I get different opinions on how, you know, some people will say that it's terrible and it messes up your SEO. Some people think it's fine and it's more important what you do the content. But if you guys were brutally honest, like, would a, how much would a, we would be open to a quote for a custom site, for things like good trips or traveling OK, or just going to cover them, allowing you guys that way out. And then the concept of a custom site, which is cool, just like this, will bring you the new dot set of fonts. I think I think I was right at that. Yeah, so we've been to a quote for that and just I don't know if you'll have any thoughts already on how limiting square spaces and if a custom site would be beneficial or if that's. Yeah, I think yeah, well definitely show you what we think that my initial kind of gut feeling is square square square space is fine for definitely setting up a business. But the idea that your guys is going is to franchise and kind of branch out. Like I got some point you definitely are going to want to change. Like it's just at some point, maybe now it's not the time. That's definitely your call. But at some point you're going to want to switch to something else because it can only support so much and it will start limiting you. I think at some point. I guess have you ran into any problems yet or is it kind of just more theoretical problem? Because not really. We kind of like being able to go and play with it. I can share some of it. So any types of no code platform like weeks or square space of any other no code platform is a lot of boiler plates in a stable. That's what probably generally saying like it is bad for you see. Because it just like here's a huge number of contents automatically there. I'm not very searching it fairly. When you create a site on your own, every line is very good. So it is something that people talk about but I'm going to go with. It depends on two things. Number one is a mileage of work anyway. Either this way or that way. We can make things work in a square space. It's just going to take more time like the way we do go high level. So looks is very important. People cares about the look and the context. Second thing about the management. What precedes like the king of the website? Like 70% website is on a board press. No doubt in that. Also, it requires you to manage it. So first question would be if you are comfortable managing your what press set as you are squashed this. Then we know the first check mark is done. Second would be designing the website. What type of website you design for you? I'm confident I can make the same thing for you in a square space or go high level. Though they will take more time because my developers are more into WordPress because that's the common technology we all use. It's going to take some time but we can make that happen. On what was quite specific to it just depends on your comfort. I'll try it as that. It's like this is like Apple. It's like Apple. It's like Apple. It's that fast. Because you know I can come up with a lot of reasons. Hey Jay, you don't do these do this but it's just going to be my point of view. We have done so many things and worked with so many clients. At the end of the day, what matters is looks and proper wording. Proper messaging no matter why do you put it. Yeah, that's kind of where my thought is but I grew chase also like. It seems like something we have to do at some point and. It'll just get harder as we have more locations so. It's something we would consider it definitely depends on how much the cost is because we. We don't have unlimited funds in brand fun but that seems like something that the if the brands if each location would benefit from that's a possibility. I put an evil idea. I'm talking your idea so the evil idea is that you do have to manage you have to make sites for other branches. The more branches you open you have to liability or responsibility to maintain the quality of the sites. If we do get into that route. Chase we can just create a. Multis are what does there's a amu what press is special type of what press where you can install multiple websites. The benefit would be there's like one head office will just create a one nice team and that team gets used by everybody. So whenever a new owner comes in he doesn't have to do much he just gets a rise. I'm pretty in a day so and it just gives you more benefit to manage five sites for a single page. And a serious taken care of looks is taken you don't have to worry about the branding color and. So that that that there would be like if we do get into a custom when you do get into a custom. Whatever we do should be something that subs every franchise every brand. Yeah. Also gives them their own privacy. Hmm. I think I can not want to be. Also, you guys can use as like a benefit of joining your franchise versus any other franchises like. The website comes done we've already spent. Money figure and out how did the SEO work, you know, we've already figured that out for you. So you know, don't really worry about it. Yeah, it's a I would say my primary concern with the website is when if so princess when we run float we've got a website that's just that location and people know that it's local and it feels local. I'd say a disadvantage to a franchise is that they're going to realize that it's one branch of multiple when you go to that site. I don't know how that affects SEO but if we could create an appearance of each location. Almost has their own site and it feels, you know, it only if it could be replicable in a way that's not crazy cost effective to stand up each page. But if we if we did it in a way where it's instead of just a page, it feels more like each location has their own site that would be really interesting because it would I feel like it would elevate that experience for franchisees and guess would feel like it was more. And local and less cookie cutter. Yeah, have you thought about like detecting uses location somewhere that we if they use a lens on round road, you can just say you were you looks like you were in San Antonio, you should be so we try. So if we don't go do going to a custom site as Chase mentioned, we can come up with some awesome ideas that would like really separate you from other people. Yeah, I mean, I can start the conversation at least and yeah, if you all wanted to see what that would. What that would cost and look like and and that's the thing is right now it's just three. Soon to be four locations that's that's easy and if you know each time somebody on boards there's a little bit of you know franchise fee and things like that so if we know what it costs to add a location and that's reasonable. And then we can pay you guys a monthly amount to maintain it that goes out of the brand fund that that supports the website. You know that would be kind of like separate from the tech fear what not. We would be yeah, we would be open to a conversation about that. Great. Cool. I'll definitely talk to those about that get us dogs and what you know. It's really what makes everybody win. That's all we care about at the end of the day. Yeah, I'm cool. Any other questions on as far as the spreadsheet was there anything that you saw? No, just outside of the website any other ideas that would help fast pace the success of Dallas and San Antonio. Just let us know and we can. You know, just agree to it and then we can pay an invoice to kind of get this going because both as you heard from Kurt because of the poor performance of the Google ads, you know they're not seeing as much traffic. As we had in the past and in San Antonio. I don't know how much that is a little bit seasonal like right right as kids are getting out of school and people are going on vacations. There's a little bit of a low but summers are usually pretty good. So we you know after I fixed our Google ads we started seeing a lot more traffic. It you know the flow opened up a week later. So anything that you guys see that could. That's kind of blocking you guys from doing. Good work that will affect both San Antonio and Dallas. We can we can talk about that. Yeah. Has anyone told you about flare AI at all? Have we talked about that? I've heard the term before. I can't remember the context but yeah I would love a refresher course. So flare AI is the brainchild of a good friend of Isaiah's that he's basically built this. Agentic system that uses like AI it uses like five AI agents and I'll call it like that the technical stuff out. Basically it's doing quite wonders for websites as far as SEO goes because. Remember on search console earlier today where you saw like the indexing like it was indexed. So vast majority of websites especially as they grow. I have a very small percentage of their pages index. I think yours is that like. Maybe 60% or something. Yeah it was almost that it was right around half yep yeah. And he's basically figured out a way to make Google index way more pages with this AI system. So that's one thing he's done and then he's also figured out a way to. Basically auto generate content like blog posts and such to bring people onto the site. And an automated way but that's different from other automated ways. It's distinct because a lot of people right now are like doing the chat GBT blogs just. Hey right me a vlog about why son is a good for you. And so he set up is a whole system that goes in like does a deep research on like questions people are asking in the market. Across maybe four of these different things like that like what are people currently like asking in the market. And then it basically. Research is the topics and then build really in depth content that Google doesn't flag unlike a lot of other stuff so actually. And so we're working with him we're trying to get that set up pretty soon. I'm not screen sharing anymore. Let me show you. And that does what you're doing that that does bring up something like. You know I asked chat GBT about sauna and perspire came up you know which is one of our competitors but we didn't so you know Google is one aspect of it but being recognized by AI search engines. Is obviously the future so if there's a way for us to get ahead of that as a franchise that is definitely something we've invested. I'm so glad you said that you jumped a gun exactly what I was going to say that's that's another part of what you figured out is indexing for. And then we're going to have a chance to be a T search and another one take one call for complexity I don't think we've heard of that. Yeah, Apple's looking at complexity they might buy it. Yeah, I just all that news yesterday yeah. That would be very interesting. And you know trying to get that integrated so we're talking with him about how that would work on. With your guys the system because you have. It's a good place and go high level so we're working with him on that trying to figure that out but I'm really excited for that and I'm wondering if that would be a good use of doing as a brand. Yeah, that would be an individual so that would for sure benefit everybody and definitely want to be ahead of this I mean it's not slowing down obviously the the AI stuff it's. Yeah, yeah, just personally I I rarely Google anymore I'm talking to chat GPT way more often. Yeah, it's just that's the future so I you know you either had a bit of behind it. Exactly super glad you're on board with that yeah we're trying to get that integrated. I'll be really exciting. You guys they do is in the first like 10 days of setting it up they go and do the research in January like 90 blogs they get posted in the first 30 days so they post like wow yeah day and they get them all out there so it's it's done a lot they've. They've been helping a lot of websites works out. So there's a name I don't even know is a silly search in optimization and there's another. So there's another worker a eo it's like answer optimization so answer engine optimization that's what AI part comes in so most of the website is trying to optimize their content for a eo this is what this that's the. The AI people are trying to read you they get content from you even journey right so it's like a simple but it's just a. Cool. Yeah so I think that's an exciting one but yeah I think if there's any other thoughts about us now but otherwise we're going to get get executing this week. Yeah yeah things rolling sounds perfect well thank you guys again for the extra time today and.

First Time Visitor Assessment Training Guide 


Each time a visitor comes in for the first time, you will need to sit with them at the bar and go over the ‘First Time Visitor Assessment’ 


This document is meant to be YOUR script for how to explain who we are, what we do, and how EVOLVE can benefit the guest!. The first line is meant to guide you thru a conversation with the guest: 


 “We are a SOCIAL WELLNESS PLAYGROUND1 where YOU CHOOSE YOUR OWN JOURNEY2,  TIMEFRAME3, & are EMPOWERED4 to SELF-REGULATE5”


TALKING POINTS/PROMPTS: 


1) SOCIAL WELLNESS PLAYGROUND 

We are a ground breaking innovative "unspa" and 4th space that allows people to interact/engage at their level of comfort. People are prioritizing connection over cocktails and seeking healthier ways to find community - we are that for our members. 


2) YOU CHOOSE YOUR OWN JOURNEY

We have 20+ modalities/10+ Zones to choose from depending on how you're currently feeling and how you want to feel when you leave. The stacks below are meant to be helpful guides in building your regimen for the visit.


3) TIMEFRAME

Benefits from a visit can be achieved in as little as 20 minutes. Depending on how much time you have, we have short stacks and long stacks to fit your schedule and what you want to achieve.


4) EMPOWERED TO SELF-REGULATE

We are constantly inundated with physical, mental, and emotional stressors whether from family, work, friends -- LIFE! This is a 4th space for you -  a place where purpose, health, and belonging intersect in real life. Here at Evolve we have tools to help you check-in with yourself, commit to yourself, and find ways to self-regulate both inside and outside of the Lab.


PAUSE to see if they have questions then proceed with, “Let’s take a moment to assess and see what’s the right fit for you!”


5) Let’s take a moment to assess and see what’s the right fit for you!: “We’re often dysregulated due to all the stressors. What brought you in and how do you want to feel when you leave?“

“Here's the stack you’ve chosen (or I’m recommending based on what you’ve shared) -- I'm going to show you the space with a  FOCUS on the modalities you'll be using today. I am going to check in with you off-and-on during your first visit and YOU can always flag me down if you have more questions or want a deeper dive.”


6) How much time do you have each week to commit to your BioHabits?
